## Issuing a Warning: The 10 Phases

When you click **Issue Warning**, you'll go through 10 phases. Don't worry—the system guides you through each one.

### Phase 1: Select Employee

**What to do:** Find and select the employee involved in the incident.

- Type their name in the search box
- Click to select them
- You'll see their current warning history

**Tip:** You can only see employees in your department.

---

### Phase 2: Category & Recommendation

**What to do:** Choose the type of misconduct and review the system's recommendation.

- Select a category (e.g., "Attendance and Punctuality")
- The system analyzes the employee's history
- It recommends an appropriate warning level

**The recommendation is based on:**
- Employee's existing warnings
- South African labour law (LRA)
- Progressive discipline principles

**You can override** the recommendation if there's a good reason (e.g., genuine emergency), but the system will record your decision.

---

### Phase 3: Incident Details

**What to do:** Document exactly what happened.

- **When:** Date and time (auto-fills with current SA time)
- **Where:** Location/department
- **What:** Describe the incident factually

**Good example:**
> "On 15 January 2026 at 08:45, the employee arrived 45 minutes late for their shift without prior notification."

**Bad example:**
> "Employee is always late and doesn't care about the job."

Stick to facts, not opinions.

---

### Phase 4: Employee Response

**What to do:** Record what the employee said.

This is crucial for fairness. The employee has a right to give their side.

**Examples:**
> "The employee stated that their car broke down on the N1 and they couldn't find phone signal to call in."

> "The employee acknowledged arriving late and apologized, stating it won't happen again."

> "The employee declined to comment."

**Tip:** Record their words, not your interpretation.

---

### Phase 5: Expected Standards

**What to do:** State clearly what is expected.

- Reference company policy if applicable
- Be specific and measurable

**Good example:**
> "All employees are expected to arrive at their workstation by 08:00 as per the employment contract. If unavoidably delayed, employees must notify their supervisor before the start of the shift."

---

### Phase 6: Improvement Plan

**What to do:** Get commitments from the employee.

- Click **Add Commitment**
- Enter what they're committing to do
- Set a timeline for each commitment
- Choose a follow-up review date

**Example commitments:**
- "I will set my alarm 30 minutes earlier" — Timeline: Immediately
- "I will keep my supervisor's number saved for emergencies" — Timeline: Today
- "I will submit medical certificate for any sick leave" — Timeline: Within 3 days

---

### Phase 7: Review Documentation

**What to do:** Check everything is correct.

- Read through all the information
- Go back to edit any phase if needed
- Make sure dates, names, and details are accurate

**This is your last chance to fix errors before signatures.**

---

### Phase 8: Script & PDF Review

**What to do:** Read the warning script to the employee.

1. Select the script language (employee's preferred language)
2. **Read the script aloud** to the employee
3. This ensures they understand the warning
4. Preview the PDF document

**Why this matters:**
- Ensures the employee fully understands
- Prevents "I didn't know" claims later
- Shows good faith on your part

---

### Phase 9: Signatures

**What to do:** Collect all required signatures.

**Order:**
1. **Manager signs first** — You sign to confirm the warning is issued
2. **Show PDF to employee** — They see the document with your signature
3. **Employee signs** — They sign to acknowledge receipt
4. **Witness (optional)** — Add a witness signature if appropriate

**If employee refuses to sign:**
- Note their refusal
- Have a witness present
- The witness signs to confirm the warning was issued

---

### Phase 10: Delivery

**What to do:** Choose how to deliver the warning document.

| Method | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Email** | Employee has email access |
| **WhatsApp** | Employee prefers WhatsApp (common for field workers) |
| **Print** | Physical copy needed for files |
| **QR Code** | Employee scans to access on their phone |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Skipping the Employee Response

**Wrong:** "They didn't say anything useful, so I left it blank."

**Right:** Record whatever they said, even if it's "Employee declined to comment" or "Employee stated they had no explanation."

---

### Mistake 2: Using Emotional Language

**Wrong:** "This employee has a terrible attitude and doesn't respect anyone."

**Right:** "The employee responded to a work instruction by saying 'This is stupid' in front of three colleagues."

---

### Mistake 3: Not Specifying Expectations

**Wrong:** "Employee needs to improve their performance."

**Right:** "Employee is expected to process a minimum of 15 customer orders per hour, as per the performance standards document dated 10 January 2026."

---

### Mistake 4: Forgetting the Follow-Up

**Wrong:** Issue warning and forget about it.

**Right:** Set a realistic review date and actually follow up. The system will remind you.

---

### Mistake 5: Treating All Misconduct the Same

**Wrong:** Jump straight to final warning for a first-time minor issue.

**Right:** Follow the system's recommendation based on:
- Severity of the misconduct
- Employee's previous history
- Progressive discipline principles

---
