## Warning Process

### How do I issue a warning?

1. Click "Issue Warning" on your dashboard
2. Follow the 10-phase wizard
3. Select employee → Choose category → Enter details → Get signatures → Deliver

The system guides you through each step.

---

### What if the employee refuses to sign?

You can still complete the warning. In the signature phase:
1. Note that the employee refused to sign
2. Have a witness present (recommended)
3. The witness can sign to confirm the warning was issued
4. The warning is still valid and recorded

---

### Can I edit a warning after it's issued?

No. Once a warning is saved with signatures, it cannot be edited. This protects the legal integrity of the document.

If you made a significant error, contact HR to discuss options.

---

### How do I add a witness signature?

In Phase 9 (Signatures):
1. After the employee signs (or refuses)
2. Click "Add Witness"
3. The witness signs on the pad
4. Enter the witness's name

---

### What warning level should I use?

The system recommends a level based on:
- The employee's warning history
- The type of misconduct
- SA labour law principles

In most cases, follow the recommendation. You can override it if there's a good reason (which will be recorded).

---

### What's the difference between counselling and a verbal warning?

- **Counselling** — Informal discussion, recorded but not punitive. For minor first-time issues.
- **Verbal warning** — Formal warning, recorded, part of progressive discipline.

Both are documented in File, but counselling is less severe.

---

### How long does a warning stay on record?

Warnings have a validity period (set during the warning process). Typical periods:
- Counselling: 3 months
- Verbal warning: 3 months
- First written: 6 months
- Final written: 12 months

After validity expires, the warning is no longer "active" but remains in the employee's history for reference.

2. The system generates a share link
3. Click the WhatsApp button
4. Select the employee's contact
5. Send

The employee receives a link to view their warning document.

---

### What if the employee doesn't have email?

Use one of the alternative delivery methods:
- **WhatsApp** — Most common alternative
- **QR Code** — Employee scans with their phone
- **Print** — Download PDF and hand it to them

---

### Can I resend a warning?

Yes. Go to the employee's profile, find the warning in their history, and click to resend via your preferred method.
