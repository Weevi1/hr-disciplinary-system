## Opening (2 minutes)

### Start with a question, not a pitch:

> "Before I show you the system, I'd like to understand your current situation. How do your managers currently handle disciplinary issues? Are they using Word templates, paper forms, or something else?"

**Listen for pain points:**
- "We just use Word documents"
- "Our managers aren't trained properly"
- "We've had issues at CCMA"
- "Warnings get lost"
- "It's inconsistent across departments"

**Acknowledge and pivot:**

> "That's exactly what we hear from most businesses. Let me show you how File solves [their specific pain point]."

### Brief overview:

> "File is a guided disciplinary system. The key word is 'guided'—it doesn't assume your managers know labour law. It walks them through step by step, and generates a legally compliant PDF at the end."

---

## Core Demo (12 minutes)

### Part 1: Dashboard Overview (2 minutes)

Show the manager dashboard:

> "When a manager logs in, they see a simple dashboard. Four big buttons: Issue Warning, Book HR Meeting, Report Absence, and Recognition. Today I'll focus on the warning process."

**Point out:**
- Clean, mobile-friendly interface
- Quick action buttons
- Team member list

### Part 2: Starting a Warning (2 minutes)

Click "Issue Warning":

> "Let's say one of our employees, John Molefe, arrived late for the third time this month. I'll select him from my team."

Select the employee:

> "Notice I can immediately see any existing warnings for this employee. The system shows me context before I even start."

### Part 3: Category & LRA Recommendation (3 minutes)

**This is the "wow moment"—slow down here:**

> "Now I choose the category—in this case, 'Attendance and Punctuality.' Watch what happens next..."

Wait for the LRA analysis:

> "The system just analyzed John's warning history against South African labour law. It's recommending a First Written Warning because he has no prior warnings in this category."

**Key points to emphasize:**
- "Your manager doesn't need to know the LRA"
- "The system makes the decision based on legal principles"
- "This prevents both under-reacting AND over-reacting"

> "If I disagreed with this—say John had a genuine emergency—I could override it. But the system keeps a record that I made a conscious decision to deviate."

### Part 4: Quick Walk Through Remaining Phases (3 minutes)

Move briskly through:

**Incident Details:**
> "When did it happen, where, and what exactly occurred. Just the facts."

**Employee Response:**
> "This is crucial—what did John say when I spoke to him? Maybe he had car trouble, maybe his child was sick. We record HIS side."

**Expected Standards:**
> "What's the rule? 'You're expected to arrive by 8:00 AM as per your employment contract.' Clear and specific."

**Improvement Plan:**
> "What is John committing to? 'I will set an earlier alarm' or 'I will inform my supervisor if I'm running late.' And when will we review this?"

**Review:**
> "Quick summary of everything before we finalize."

### Part 5: The Script (2 minutes)

**Another wow moment:**

> "Here's where it gets interesting. The system generates a script—in John's preferred language. We support all 11 official South African languages."

Show language dropdown:

> "If John speaks isiZulu at home, I can read him this warning in isiZulu. He can't later claim he didn't understand."

Read a few lines of the script:

> "It's written in plain language, not legal jargon. And it covers everything the LRA requires—his right to representation, his right to appeal."

### Part 6: Signatures and PDF (2 minutes)

> "Now we both sign digitally, right here on the screen."

Show signature pad:

> "I sign first, then John gets to preview the actual PDF—he sees exactly what he's signing. Then he signs."

Show PDF preview:

> "This is the final document. Professional letterhead, all the details, signatures with timestamps. This goes into John's permanent record and can be downloaded or emailed."

## Differentiation (3 minutes)

### vs Word Templates:

> "I often hear 'We already have Word templates.' The problem with templates is they don't guide you through the process. Managers skip sections, use wrong language, forget to get signatures. And when you get to CCMA, the commissioner looks at a messy Word document and a professional PDF—which one looks more credible?"

### Mobile Demo (optional):

> "Let me show you something. I'm opening the same system on my phone... [pause while loading] ... see? Same functionality. Your supervisor in the warehouse can issue a warning right there, immediately after an incident, while the details are fresh."

### ROI Reality Check:

> "Quick question—have you ever had a case go to CCMA?"

If yes:
> "So you know what that costs. Legal fees, management time, potential payouts. File is R[X] per year. One prevented case pays for five years of the system."

If no:
> "That's good—and you want to keep it that way. But statistically, if you have more than 50 employees, it's not a matter of if, but when. File is insurance that also makes your HR processes better."

## Close (3 minutes)

### Summarize Value:

> "To summarize: File gives your managers a system they can't misuse. It guides them through the LRA requirements, generates proper documentation, and creates a paper trail that protects your business."

### Handle Questions:

> "What questions do you have?"

**Common questions and responses:**

**"What about our existing warning history?"**
> "We have a historical warning entry feature for the first 60 days. Your team can backdate existing warnings to build a complete record."

**"Who sets up the system?"**
> "We handle the initial setup—importing your employees, configuring departments, setting up manager accounts. Takes about an hour of your time."

**"Can we customize the categories?"**
> "Yes, you can add your own misconduct categories and the system will incorporate them into the LRA analysis."

### Next Steps:

> "The next step would be getting you set up on a trial. We can import your real employees and you can try it with a few test warnings. Would next week work to get you started?"

**If they need to discuss internally:**
> "Completely understand. I'll send you the one-pager and pricing sheet by email. When would be a good time for me to follow up?"

## Demo Notes

### If They Say "We Use Word":

> "Word is fine for typing. But it's not a process. It doesn't tell the manager what questions to ask, doesn't check if they've followed the steps, doesn't recommend the right warning level. And every document looks different depending on who typed it."

### If They Want a Discount:

> "Our pricing is based on employee count, so larger companies do pay more in total but less per employee. The real question is: what's the cost if you DON'T have proper documentation? One CCMA case costs more than a decade of File."

### If They Ask About Competitors:

> "There are other HR systems, but most are built for American or European markets and adapted for SA. File was built specifically for South African labour law, by South Africans, for South African businesses. The 11-language support alone tells you this isn't a port from overseas."

### If They Want to "Think About It":

> "Of course. What specific concerns would you want to think through? Sometimes I can address those now and save you time."
