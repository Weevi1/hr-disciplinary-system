Hi [Name],

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I enjoyed learning about [Company Name] and your approach to managing your team.

I understand you need some time to [discuss internally / consider your options / get approval]. That's completely reasonable.

In the meantime, I've attached:

**Key points to remember:**
- Starting from R[X]/month for your [X] employees

Would it be helpful if I scheduled a brief demo for [decision maker name / your team / the HR manager]? I'm happy to walk through the system with anyone who'd like to see it.

## Template 5: Follow-Up — No Response

**Use when:** You sent a quote/info but haven't heard back (wait 3-5 business days)

**Subject:** Quick Follow-Up — File by FIFO

---

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on our conversation from [date] about File by FIFO.

I know things get busy, so I'll keep this brief:

- Did you have a chance to review the information I sent?
- Do you have any questions I can help answer?
- Would it be helpful to schedule a quick call?

If now isn't the right time, no problem — just let me know and I'll check back in a few months.

If you're ready to move forward, I'm happy to send the order form whenever works for you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Phone]

P.S. Remember, one prevented CCMA case pays for over 5 years of File. It's peace of mind you can't afford not to have.

## Template 6: Price Objection Follow-Up

**Use when:** They said it's too expensive in the meeting

**Subject:** The Real Cost — A Quick Thought

---

Hi [Name],

Thanks again for our meeting. I've been thinking about your concern about the investment.

Here's a different way to look at it:

**The Math:**
- File for [Company Name]: R[X]/year
- Average CCMA case (if lost): R180,000+
- Break-even: One case every [X] years

**The Question:**
How confident are you that every manager in your business will handle every disciplinary situation correctly for the next [X] years?

File isn't an expense — it's insurance. And unlike insurance, it actively helps you avoid claims by ensuring proper process every time.

I'd be happy to discuss this further or explore options that might work better for your budget. Would a quick call help?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Phone]
