# File by FIFO

**Disciplinary Management Made Simple**

---

## The Problem

Every day, South African businesses face CCMA claims that could have been prevented with proper documentation. The reality:

- Untrained managers make procedural mistakes
- Paper warnings get lost or disputed
- No one reads 200-page labour law manuals
- One bad termination = R180,000+ in legal fees and awards

**You shouldn't need a law degree to manage your team fairly.**

## The Solution

**File by FIFO** is a guided disciplinary system that ensures every warning follows SA labour law—even if the manager has never done it before.

### How It Works

1. **Manager Opens App** — Select employee, describe incident
2. **System Guides Process** — 10-phase wizard with built-in LRA compliance
3. **PDF Generated Instantly** — Professional document, digitally signed, delivered
