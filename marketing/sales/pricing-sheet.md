## The ROI Analysis

### The Cost of CCMA Cases

| Item | Typical Cost |
|------|--------------|
| Attorney consultation | R2,500–R5,000 |
| CCMA representation (per day) | R8,000–R15,000 |
| Preparation and documentation | R5,000–R10,000 |
| Unfair dismissal award | 12–24 months salary |
| Reputational damage | Incalculable |

**Average total cost of lost CCMA case: R180,000+**

### The Math (Real Example)

**Company with 75 employees:**

- File annual cost: R12,000
- One CCMA case avoided: R180,000 (conservatively)
- **ROI: 15x return on investment**

Even if File only prevents **one case every 15 years**, it pays for itself.

## How Businesses Typically Lose at CCMA

1. **No written warning** — Manager gave verbal warning but nothing documented
2. **Skipped progressive discipline** — Jumped straight to dismissal
3. **Wrong procedure** — Didn't allow employee to respond
4. **Lost documents** — Warning existed but can't find it
5. **Language barrier** — Employee didn't understand the warning

**File eliminates all five failure points.**
