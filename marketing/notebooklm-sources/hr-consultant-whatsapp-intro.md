## Message Option 1: The Hook (Before Video)

```
Hi [Name], hope you're well.

Quick question - how often do you arrive at a client for a hearing and find the warning file is a mess (or missing)?

I've partnered with a system that makes it impossible for managers to skip steps. 10-phase wizard, signatures, PDFs, 11 languages - the works.

Thought of you because there's a 50% commission for every client you bring on. Passive income on top of your fees.

Sending you a 2-min video that explains it better than I can type. Let me know what you think?

## Message Option 2: Direct Pitch

```
Hi [Name]

You know how employers lose at the CCMA even when the dismissal was fair? Because managers don't document properly?

There's a new SA system called File that fixes this. Guided wizard, can't skip steps, auto-generates LRA-compliant PDFs.

They're looking for HR consultants as partners - 50% recurring commission on every client.

Worth a 5-min chat? Could be R50k+ passive income for you annually.

## Message Option 3: After They've Watched the Video

```
What did you think?

The way I see it:
1. Your clients get compliant (fewer CCMA losses)
2. Your job gets easier (paperwork is done before you arrive)
3. You earn 50% of every subscription fee, every year

A typical portfolio of 12 clients = R50-85k/year passive.

Want me to set up a quick demo so you can see it yourself?

## Message Option 4: For Someone You Know Well

```
[Name], remember that case last year where [Client X] lost at CCMA because of the missing warnings?

Found something that would have prevented that. System called File - literally walks managers through every step. They can't skip documentation.

The partner deal is 50% commission, recurring. I'm already signed up.

Send you the video? Think this is right up your alley.

## Message Option 5: Casual Referral Request

```
Hey, random question.

Do you know any other HR consultants who'd be interested in earning passive income from their client base?

There's a new SA warning/disciplinary system looking for partners. 50% recurring commission.

Solves the "no documentation" problem we all complain about.

Happy to explain if you know anyone - or if you're curious yourself.

## Follow-Up Message (If No Response After 3 Days)

```
Hey [Name], just checking if you got the video?

No pressure - just thought it might be relevant given your client base.

Let me know if you want more info or a quick demo.
```

## Closing Message (After Positive Response)

```
Great! Let me connect you with Riaan from FIFO - he built the system and handles the partner onboarding.

He can give you a proper demo and answer any questions about the commission structure.

What's your availability this week?
