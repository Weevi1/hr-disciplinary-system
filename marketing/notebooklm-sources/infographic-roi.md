## Main Headline
**One CCMA Case vs. Years of Protection**

---

## Section 1: What a CCMA Case Really Costs

**Legal Fees**
- Attorney consultation: R2,500 – R5,000
- CCMA representation per day: R8,000 – R15,000
- Case preparation: R5,000 – R10,000

**If You Lose**
- Unfair dismissal award: 12–24 months salary
- Employee earning R25,000/month = R300,000 – R600,000

**Total Cost of One Bad Case: R150,000 – R500,000+**

## Section 2: Why Businesses Lose

Five reasons — none about whether dismissal was justified:

1. **No written warning** — Manager warned verbally, no documentation
2. **Skipped steps** — Jumped to dismissal without progressive discipline
3. **Lost paperwork** — Warning existed but can't be found
4. **Wrong procedure** — Employee wasn't given chance to respond
5. **Language barrier** — Employee claims they didn't understand

**File prevents all five.**

## Section 3: The Comparison

**Without File:**
- Word templates (if you're lucky)
- Paper files (if they don't get lost)
- Hope managers know what to do
- Panic when CCMA calls

**With File:**
- Guided 10-phase process
- Cloud storage forever
- System ensures compliance
- Evidence ready instantly

## Section 4: The Math

**Example: 75-employee company**

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| File annual subscription | R12,000 |
| File over 10 years | R120,000 |
| One CCMA case (lost) | R180,000+ |

**One prevented case = 15 years of File paid for.**

---

## Section 5: Daily Cost Breakdown

**File costs less than a daily coffee.**

- 75 employees: R12,000/year
- Monthly: R1,000
- Daily: R33

For R33/day, every manager issues legally compliant warnings.
