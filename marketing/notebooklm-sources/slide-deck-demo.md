# File by FIFO — Sales Demo Presentation

## Slide 1: Title
**File by FIFO**
Disciplinary Management Made Simple
*Protect your business from CCMA claims while treating employees fairly*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Every year, SA businesses lose millions at CCMA**

Not because dismissals were wrong — because documentation was wrong.

- Managers untrained in labour law
- Paper warnings get lost
- Progressive discipline not followed
- Language barriers cause disputes

---

## Slide 3: The Cost of Getting It Wrong

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Legal fees | R15,000 – R50,000 |
| Management time | R5,000 – R15,000 |
| Unfair dismissal award | 12–24 months salary |
| **Typical total** | **R150,000 – R500,000+** |

One bad case can cripple a small business.

## Slide 4: The Solution
**File by FIFO — A guided warning system**

Think TurboTax for disciplinary matters.
