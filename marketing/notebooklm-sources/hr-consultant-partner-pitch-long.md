# The HR Consultant's Dilemma: Why Your Clients Keep Failing at the CCMA (And How to Fix It While Earning Passive Income)

## A Scene You've Lived a Hundred Times

Picture this. It's Tuesday morning. Your phone rings.

It's a client—a manufacturing company with 80 employees. The operations manager sounds stressed. "We need to dismiss James. He's been late 15 times in three months. Insubordinate. Refuses to follow instructions. The other staff are complaining. We can't take it anymore."

You ask the obvious question: "What warnings have you issued?"

Silence.

Then: "Well, his supervisor spoke to him about it. Multiple times."

"In writing?"

"I think there was an email..."

You already know how this ends.

You drive out to their premises. You spend two hours trying to piece together what happened. There's a vague email from four months ago that mentions "performance concerns" but doesn't specify incidents. There's nothing signed. No dates. No employee acknowledgment. No record of what improvement was expected.

You have two choices. Tell them they can't dismiss—and watch a genuinely problematic employee continue disrupting their business. Or proceed with the dismissal—and pray the employee doesn't refer to the CCMA.

Three months later, you're sitting in that CCMA hearing room. The commissioner asks for the warning file. There isn't one.

The employer loses. Twelve months' compensation. R180,000 gone.

And you're the one who has to explain why.

## This Isn't About Bad Employers

Here's what frustrates you: this client isn't malicious. They're not trying to unfairly dismiss anyone. James genuinely was a problem. The dismissal was substantively fair—he deserved to go.

But substantive fairness doesn't matter if procedural fairness is missing.

And procedural fairness fails because of one thing: managers don't document.

They don't document because:
- They don't know how
- They don't have time
- They think verbal warnings count
- They lose the paperwork
- HR templates are confusing
- They're managers, not HR professionals

You've seen this pattern across dozens of clients. Good businesses. Good intentions. Terrible documentation.

And when it goes wrong, you're the one standing in the CCMA trying to defend the indefensible.

## The Real Numbers

Let's talk about what's actually happening in South Africa.

The CCMA handles over 100,000 cases per year. Fifty-two percent of those—more than 52,000 cases—are unfair dismissal claims.

That's 52,000 employers per year standing in front of a commissioner, trying to justify why they fired someone.

How many of those employers have a complete, signed, dated warning file? Based on your experience—how many?

Twenty percent? Ten percent?

The ones who lose aren't losing because the dismissal was unfair. They're losing because they can't prove it was fair.

A typical CCMA case costs:
- Legal consultation: R2,500 to R5,000
- CCMA representation: R7,000 for the first day, R4,700 for each additional day
- Case preparation: R5,000 to R10,000

That's R15,000 to R25,000 even if you win.

If you lose? The commissioner can award up to 12 months' compensation. For an employee earning R25,000 a month, that's R300,000.

One case. One missing warning file. R300,000.

## What If There Was a System That Made Mistakes Impossible?

This is where File comes in.

File is a cloud-based HR system built specifically for South African labour law. But it's not a generic HR platform. It's laser-focused on one thing: making sure managers document properly.

Here's how it works.

When a manager needs to issue a warning, they open File. They select the employee. They select the category of misconduct—and the system immediately shows them what the Labour Relations Act recommends for that offense.

Then it walks them through a 10-phase wizard:
1. Confirm the employee
2. Select the category and see the recommended sanction
3. Document the incident—date, time, what happened
4. Record the employee's response
5. Document the expected standards going forward
6. Create an improvement plan
7. Review everything
8. Read the formal warning script (in any of 11 South African languages)
9. Collect signatures—digital, on any device
10. Deliver the warning—email, WhatsApp, print, or QR code

At the end, a professionally formatted PDF is generated. Timestamped. Signed. Stored in the cloud forever.

The manager can't skip steps. They can't "forget" to document. They can't lose the paperwork.

When you arrive for that dismissal hearing, everything is there. The full history. Every warning. Every signature. Every date.

## How This Changes Your Practice

Think about what this means for you.

No more arriving at clients to find chaos. No more piecing together emails and verbal recollections. No more advising clients to back down from justified dismissals because there's no paper trail.

Your clients are prepared. Your hearings succeed. Your reputation grows.

And here's the thing—you're not just recommending a product. You can partner with File and earn from every client you bring on.

## The Partner Opportunity

File offers a reseller partnership with 50% commission on all subscription fees.

Not 50% of the first year. Fifty percent of every payment, for as long as the client stays subscribed.

Let's do the math on a typical HR consultant's client portfolio.

Say you have 12 clients. A realistic mix:
- 3 small businesses (under 20 employees): R5,000/year each
- 4 medium businesses (21-50 employees): R8,000/year each
- 3 larger businesses (51-100 employees): R12,000/year each
- 2 bigger operations (100-300 employees): R15,000/year each

Total subscription value: R113,000 per year.

Your 50% commission: R56,500 per year.

That's passive income. You introduce the client once. They sign up directly with File. You get paid every year they renew.

By year two, if you've added another 6 clients, you're earning R85,000 per year in commissions.

This isn't replacing your consulting income. It's adding to it. And it's making your primary work easier and more successful.

## Why This Makes Sense for HR Consultants Specifically

You might be thinking: "I could recommend lots of software. Why this?"

Because File solves YOUR problem, not just your client's problem.

Generic HR software helps with leave management, payroll, org charts. That's nice, but it doesn't help you when you're standing in the CCMA.

File is built for one purpose: creating the documentation you need to win cases.

Every feature exists to answer the question a commissioner will ask:
- "When was the employee warned?" — Timestamped.
- "Did they understand the warning?" — Signed acknowledgment, in their home language.
- "What were they told to improve?" — Documented improvement plan.
- "Was progressive discipline followed?" — Full warning history visible.

This is the system you wish every client had before you met them.

Now you can make sure they do.

## The Clients Who Need This Most

Think about your client base. Who's at highest risk?

- Growing businesses (20-100 employees) that don't have an HR manager
- Owner-managed companies where the boss handles HR personally
- Multi-site operations where managers work independently
- Industries with high turnover: retail, hospitality, manufacturing, security
- Businesses that have been burned before and never want to go through it again

These are the clients who will thank you for bringing this to them.

## What It Takes to Get Started

If you're interested in becoming a File partner, here's what happens:

1. You get access to a demo account so you can see exactly how it works
2. You receive sales materials—one-pagers, pricing sheets, objection handling guides
3. You introduce File to your clients the way you already give advice: "This is what you need."
4. Clients sign up directly. You get paid monthly as they pay their subscriptions.

There's no inventory. No upfront cost. No complicated contracts.

You're doing what you already do—advising clients on HR compliance—and now you're getting paid when they take your advice.

## The Bottom Line

You've spent years helping employers navigate South African labour law. You know the frustration of watching good companies lose CCMA cases because of bad documentation.

File fixes that problem upstream. Before the hearing. Before the dismissal. At the moment the manager needs to issue a warning.

And for the first time, you can earn from solving this problem—not just once, but every year, with every client.

Your clients win. Your practice grows. Your hearings succeed.

If you want to learn more, let's have a conversation. This could be the best decision you make for your practice this year.
