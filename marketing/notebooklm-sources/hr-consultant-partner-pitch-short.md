# For HR Consultants: Stop Fighting With One Hand Tied Behind Your Back

## The Frustration You Know Too Well

You get the call. A client needs you to handle a dismissal. Maybe it's misconduct, maybe poor performance, maybe the employee just isn't working out.

You arrive ready to do your job.

And then you ask the question: "Show me the warnings."

And that's when it falls apart.

"We gave him a verbal warning." No documentation. "I'm sure we sent an email." Can't find it. "The manager definitely spoke to him about it." Nothing in writing.

You know what happens next. You can't execute the dismissal. Or worse—you proceed, and three months later you're at the CCMA watching your client lose R150,000 because there's no paper trail.

This isn't your fault. But you're the one who has to deliver the bad news.

## What If Your Clients Couldn't Make These Mistakes?

There's a system called File that makes it impossible for managers to skip steps.

It's a 10-phase guided wizard. The manager picks the employee, selects the offense, and the system walks them through everything—the conversation, the documentation, the employee's response, the signatures. At the end, a legally compliant PDF is generated and stored forever.

No more "I forgot to document it." No more lost paperwork. No more managers doing verbal warnings for serious offenses.

When you arrive for that hearing, everything is there. Timestamped. Signed. Ready.

## Here's the Opportunity

You could just recommend File to your clients and move on.

Or you could partner with the company behind it and earn 50% of every subscription fee—every year, for as long as your client stays subscribed.

A typical client portfolio of 12 businesses? That's R50,000 to R85,000 per year in passive income. On top of your consulting fees.

And the best part? Your job gets easier. Your clients are prepared. Your hearings succeed.

You're not selling software. You're solving a problem you've been frustrated by for years—and getting paid for it.

If that sounds interesting, let's talk.
