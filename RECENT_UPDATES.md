## 📋 NEW FEATURE REQUESTS

### **Feature Request: Bulk Employee-Manager Assignment (2025-09-30)**

**Request**: Add bulk employee assignment to managers in Employee Management

**Current Behavior**:
- Manager assignment happens individually when editing an employee
- HR must edit each employee one at a time to assign manager
- Time-consuming for organizations with many employees

**Requested Feature**:
- Add bulk selection capability to Employee Management (HR role only)
- Multi-select employees via checkboxes in employee list
- Bulk action toolbar appears when employees selected
- "Assign to Manager" dropdown showing available managers
- Apply manager assignment to all selected employees at once

**User Story**:
> As an HR manager, I want to select multiple employees and assign them all to a manager in one action, so I can streamline the onboarding and team restructuring workflows.

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Only show managers (users with department_manager or hr_manager roles) in dropdown
- Maintain audit trail for bulk assignments
- Show confirmation dialog with employee count before applying
- Success/error feedback for bulk operation
- Update employee records in batch via EmployeeService
