## Go-To-Market Hardening — commercial-path gaps closed (2026-07-17)

Pre-launch session ahead of the email campaign (direct invoicing + EFT). Full assessment + remaining owner-tasks in `MONITORING_SETUP.md` and the session summary. **Not yet deployed** — needs `firebase deploy` (functions + hosting + firestore:rules) after review.

**Repo safety.** The 2026-06-04 production-deployed working tree (35 files) was finally committed; `prelaunch-tier0-tier1` merged → `master`, both pushed. Stale dead `functions/lib/billing.js` removed. `.git.corrupt-laptop/` (120MB) moved out to `~/development/backups/`.

**Onboarding wizard fixed** (`EnhancedOrganizationWizard.tsx`). The hardcoded `temp123` admin password is gone — a strong one-time password (`Xxxx-Xxxx-Xxxx`, crypto-random) is generated per deployment and shown once on a new success screen with a copy button. Admin creation was already server-side (`createOrganizationAdmin` callable) so the "logout mid-flow" comments were stale — removed; default departments are now expected to succeed. `createOrganizationAdmin` now honors `requirePasswordChange` (sets `mustChangePassword` regardless of password value).

**Suspend kill-switch + real trials.** New `subscriptionStatus` semantics: `active` / `trial` (with `trialEndsAt` Timestamp) / `suspended`. Enforced server-side in `config/firestore.rules` via new `orgOperational()`/`activeOrgMember()` (42 sharded-collection call sites; org doc itself stays readable so the app can show the lock screen) and client-side via `frontend/src/utils/subscription.ts` + a full-screen suspended/trial-expired screen and a trial-countdown banner in `MainLayout` (platform roles exempt). SuperAdminDashboard org table gained a Status column + Suspend/Reactivate/Activate buttons (`AdminDataService.updateOrganization`). The org wizard step 1 now offers **Active (invoiced client)** vs **Free trial (14/30/60/90 days)**. Demo orgs unaffected.

**Public endpoint throttling.** `submitEmployeeResponse`, `submitEmployeeAppeal`, `uploadResponseEvidence` now share a per-token rolling-hour write limit (`enforceWriteRateLimit`, 20/hr, separate `writeCount`/`writeWindowStart` fields) — previously only the view endpoint was rate-limited.

**Lead capture.** New public function `submitDemoRequest` (`functions/src/leads.ts`): validates + sanitizes, honeypot field, per-IP 5/hr Firestore rate limit, writes `leads/{id}`, emails riaan@fifo.systems via SendGrid. Landing page gained a "Book a Demo" form section (`#demo`); both dead-end "Start Free Trial" CTAs (previously → `/login` wall) now point at it. Landing CSP `connect-src` allows the function origin.

**Monitoring.** Frontend Sentry DSN confirmed present in production bundles (lives in gitignored `frontend/.env.local` — build-machine dependency). Cloud Functions error alerting still needs a 5-minute one-time setup with Riaan's owner account — exact steps in `MONITORING_SETUP.md`.

## Step 5 Delivery — WhatsApp + Printed made real (2026-06-04)

Wizard Step 5 offered four delivery cards (Email, QR, WhatsApp, Printed); only Email and QR worked. WhatsApp and Printed were silent stubs that recorded `deliveryStatus: 'pending'` forever with nothing sent. Both are now functional.

**WhatsApp delivery.** Manager picks WhatsApp → panel pre-fills the employee's number (`profile.whatsappNumber || profile.phoneNumber`, editable) and requires an "I confirmed this number with the employee" checkbox → opens `https://wa.me/<digits>?text=…` on the manager's device with a professional message + a durable respond link. WhatsApp's click-to-chat can't pre-attach a file, so the PDF is delivered as the existing **respond/appeal link** (`generateResponseToken`, bumped to a **6-month** lifetime via a new optional `expiryDays` param) rather than a native attachment. Manager attests "I've sent it" → records honest delivery. New shared `frontend/src/utils/phone.ts` (`formatPhoneNumber` extracted out of `useEmployeeImport.ts`, plus `toWhatsAppNumber`/`isValidPhoneNumber`).

**Printed delivery (collect from HR).** Manager picks Printed → panel explains the employee collects a printed copy from HR → "Notify HR & Finalize" records `deliveryStatus: 'awaiting_collection'` and calls a new callable `notifyHRPrintedCollection` that emails HR managers (new `printed_collection` branch in the HR-notification email template). The warning surfaces in HR's Review-dashboard queue as **Awaiting Collection**; HR uses the existing **Deliver → EnhancedDeliveryWorkflow → PrintDeliveryGuide** (print → hand over with date/location/witness → file) to complete it.

**Bug fixed.** `ReviewDashboard` `onDeliveryComplete` wrote `status: 'delivered'` but **not** `deliveryStatus` — so HR-delivered warnings stayed stuck in the undelivered queue and the captured proof (location/witness) was discarded. Now writes `deliveryStatus: 'delivered'` + appends a `deliveryHistory` entry with `deliveredBy` + proof. Fixes Email/WhatsApp HR-side delivery too.

**Pattern.** Email, WhatsApp and Printed are *self-finalizing* panels — each writes its own `deliveryMethod`/`deliveryStatus`/`deliveryHistory` and fires the celebration, so all three are excluded from the generic DELIVERY-phase validation and `handleFinalize` guard. Only QR uses the shared Finalize button. New `DeliveryStatus` value `'awaiting_collection'` added (safe — the codebase only does `=== 'delivered'`/`!== 'delivered'` checks).

**Deployed (2026-06-04):** `generateResponseToken` (expiryDays), `notifyHRPrintedCollection` (new), and frontend hosting. Both features live in production.

## V2 Warning Wizard — Build, Iteration & Cutover (2026-06-03)

### Cutover note (moved from CLAUDE.md)
- **✅ V2 is now THE warning wizard.** Every entry point (HOD Dashboard "Issue Warning" button + `/warnings/create` route) opens V2. The dashed "Beta" button and BETA chip are gone. Saved warnings carry `wizardVersion: 'v2'`.
- **Deleted**: `enhanced/UnifiedWarningWizard.tsx` (V1, 1645 lines), `enhanced/EnhancedWarningWizard.tsx` (already unused), `enhanced/modals/AudioConsentModal.tsx` (V1-only).
- **Kept under `enhanced/`** because V2 still imports them: `phases/*`, `shared/*`, `steps/components/*`, `wizardHelpers.ts`, `wizardTypes.ts`, `PDFPreviewModal.tsx`, `components/MicrophonePermissionHandler.tsx`.
- **Follow-up reorg ideas (not done)**: drop the `V2` suffix; flatten `warnings/enhanced/` into `warnings/`; audit `modal-system.css` for dead `.enhanced-warning-wizard-container` `!important` rules.


A full day of work consolidated. Started as a parallel test build, iterated through 7 UX patches based on Riaan's testing, finished with a cutover that retires V1.

**Build.** New `frontend/src/components/warnings/v2/` folder with `UnifiedWarningWizardV2.tsx` orchestrator + 6 phase components (`WizardOverviewPhase`, `SetupPhaseV2`, `IncidentPhaseV2`, `ConversationPhaseV2`, `SignAndSavePhaseV2`, `DeliveryPhaseV2`) + `wizardTypesV2.ts`. Composition over rewrite: V2 reuses every V1 phase component (`WordCountTextareaPhase`, `ImprovementPlanPhase`, `CategoryRecommendationPhase`, `IncidentDetailsForm`, `ReviewDocumentationPhase`, `ScriptPdfReviewPhase`, `SignaturesPhase`, `DeliveryPhase`) plus the LRA engine, PDF generator, signature canvas, Firestore schema, and Cloud Functions. V2 collapses V1's 10 phases into a 10-second intro overview + 5 working steps along natural conversation lines.

**Surprise eliminations.** Audio recording now starts only when the user clicks Continue on the intro (not silently on wizard open). Escalation risk surfaces immediately after employee picked, before category. "Conversation" sections grey out (don't vanish) for Final Written level. PDF preview button announced upfront on the intro.

**Iteration patches (all in `lessons.md` for future-self):**
1. **Modal scroll trap.** `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto` inside `max-h-[90vh] flex flex-col` silently fails to engage scroll in Chrome — the flex child can't compute a definite height under a max constraint. Fix: definite `h-[90vh]` on modal + inline `flex: '1 1 0%'` + `minHeight: 0` on the scroll container. Recorded in `memory/modal_scroll_trap.md`.
2. **Evidence "Optional" badge.** Added to shared `EvidenceUploader.tsx` label — accurate for all callers (V1/V2/appeals) since evidence is never required. Plus a framing hint at the top of the V2 Incident phase.
3. **Early escalation badge.** Setup phase shows active-warning count immediately after employee selected, before category — so the HR Intervention gate isn't an ambush later.
4. **Expected Standards refresh on category switch.** Bug: pre-population fired only when textarea empty, so switching category left stale text. Fix: dirty-check ref tracks previous category's template; refresh if untouched, preserve user edits.
5. **Improvement Plan clarity.** Bare admin form (`Action Commitments`, `Validity Period`) replaced with intro line, helper subtitles, empty-state example commitment card, and a grouped "Warning record" cluster for Date issued + Stays active for.
6. **"+ Add Commitment" → "+ Another Commitment"** when list isn't empty + shrunk to `text-xs` so it sits visually subordinate to commitment cards.
7. **PDF-review tile + checkbox cleanup.** "Step 2: Review PDF with Employee" + standalone "Employee has reviewed the document" checkbox → single tile reading "Show the warning to the employee" / "Tap to open the warning so the employee can read it before signing." Tapping the tile auto-flips `employeeViewedPDF`. Redundant checkbox deleted.

**Cutover (final).** [App.tsx:15](frontend/src/App.tsx#L15) lazy import retargeted from `enhanced/UnifiedWarningWizard` to `v2/UnifiedWarningWizardV2`. [HODDashboardSection.tsx](frontend/src/components/dashboard/HODDashboardSection.tsx) collapsed: dual lazy imports → one, dual state vars → one, dual handlers → one, dashed beta button → deleted, dual render block → one. BETA chip removed from V2 header. Deleted files: `enhanced/UnifiedWarningWizard.tsx` (1645 lines), `enhanced/EnhancedWarningWizard.tsx` (legacy/unused), `enhanced/modals/AudioConsentModal.tsx` (no consumers). Kept everything else in `enhanced/` since V2 imports those (phases, shared chrome, steps, helpers, types, `PDFPreviewModal`, `MicrophonePermissionHandler`).

Saved warnings still carry `wizardVersion: 'v2'` as a harmless historical marker. Firestore schema unchanged. Cloud Functions unchanged.

## Session 67 (2026-04-24) — Reseller Demo Organizations

- **✅ Reseller demo organizations** — Resellers can deploy pre-populated demo orgs for prospect testing, separate from paying-client lifecycle
- **Backend**: 4 new Cloud Functions in `functions/src/Reseller/demoManagement.ts` — `deployDemoOrganization`, `createDemoProspectLogin`, `resetDemoOrganization`, `deleteDemoOrganization`. Max 5 concurrent demos per reseller (separate quota from real deployments). Seed data in `demoSeedData.ts` (10 canonical SA employees) and `demoCategories.ts` (8 LRA categories)
- **Frontend**: `ResellerDemoService.ts` + 5 new components under `components/reseller/demos/` (MyDemos list + 4 modals). New "My Demos" tab on ResellerDashboard, desktop + mobile
- **Org schema**: Added `isDemo?: boolean` and `demoMetadata?: { resellerId, createdAt, lastResetAt, resetCount, activeProspectLoginIds }` to `Organization`. Added `resellerId` + `isDemoProspect` to `User`. Added `'reseller'` to `UserRoleId` (fixed pre-existing type gap)
- **Safety rails**: Persistent amber `DEMO ORGANIZATION` banner in MainLayout. `AdminDataService.getResellerClients` filters out `isDemo: true`. Cron/trigger guards added to `reviewFollowUpCron.ts`, `warningDelivery.ts`, and `notifyHROnAppeal.ts` so demo orgs never generate SendGrid bounces on fake `@demo.local` addresses
- **Indexes deployed**: `organizations (resellerId, isDemo)` and `organizations (resellerId, isDemo, isActive)` in `config/firestore.indexes.json`
- **Reset semantics**: Full re-seed to pristine template — wipes warnings, evidence, response tokens, prospect logins, employees, departments; re-seeds the 10 canonical employees + Operations/Admin departments. Reset count is tracked

---

## Session 66 (2026-03-09) — PDF Quality Improvements & HR Intervention UX

- **✅ Unified HR intervention messages** — Merged `hasFinalWarningBlock`/`hasDismissalRedirect` into a single `hrInterventionRequired` state in `UnifiedWarningWizard.tsx` with context-aware UI and a graceful "I Understand" close
- **✅ Spinner fix** — LRA loading animation no longer persists when intervention message appears
- **✅ PDF corrective data fix** — `WarningDetailsModal.tsx` now passes `employeeStatement`, `expectedBehaviorStandards`, `actionSteps`, `reviewDate` into the PDF pipeline
- **✅ PDF v1.2.0 fallback path** — Added corrective discussion section renderers to the no-template code path
- **✅ PDF improvements (universal)**: (B)(C)(E)(F) section labels, continuation headers on page 2+, "Electronically signed by [name] on [date]" under signatures, "Immediately" default in timeline, Manager/Employee initial spots on all pages except last

---

## Session 64 (2026-02-12) — Evidence Upload Optimization, Security Hardening & Warning Archive

- **✅ Client-side image optimization** — New `imageOptimizer.ts` resizes to max 1920px, compresses JPEG 0.8. Phone photos 5-10MB → ~200-400KB
- **✅ Evidence upload security** — `file.makePublic()` replaced with download token URLs, storage rules hardened, thumbnail stripped from Firestore, silent failure fixed with user warning banner, filename/MIME mismatch fixed
- **✅ Bug Fix: Archive didn't remove from LRA** — `API.warnings.archive()` now sets `isActive: false` so archived warnings stop affecting escalation. `HRDashboardSection` filter updated to check `!isArchived`
- **✅ Archive in WarningDetailsModal** — Archive button with reason selector (test data, issued in error, duplicate, overturned, expired, manual). Inline confirmation dialog with explanation. Shows "Archived (reason)" badge if already archived. Wired from `HRDashboardSection` via `onArchive` prop

---

## Session 63 (2026-02-11) — Reseller User Creation Bug Fixes & Audio Auto-Stop

- **Bug Fix: Reseller user creation** — `ShardedOrganizationService.createAdminUser()` was missing `uid` field and saving role as raw string instead of normalized object
- **Bug Fix: `issuedBy` empty on warnings** — Executive user had no `uid` in Firestore. Added `user?.id` fallback
- **Bug Fix: Audio recording lost on auto-stop** — Save handler now checks for stopped recordings with data (`audioUrl`)
- **Firestore Fix: Adam Swanepoel** — Manually patched user doc: added `uid`, normalized role
- **Files**: `ShardedOrganizationService.ts`, `UnifiedWarningWizard.tsx`

---

## Session 62 (2026-02-11) — Multi-Dashboard Theming in Branding & CI Tab

### **✅ Multi-Dashboard Theming**
- Extended `DashboardThemeSettings` type in `core.ts` with `hrDashboard?.metricColors` (5 fields: absenceReports, meetingRequests, activeWarnings, reviewFollowups, totalEmployees) and `executiveDashboard?.metricColors` (4 fields: totalEmployees, activeWarnings, highPriority, departments). All optional — no migration needed
- Added `customColor?: string` to `MetricCard` interface in `DashboardShell.tsx` — used as override over semantic `GRADIENT_COLORS` in both mobile and desktop metric card rendering
- `HRDashboardSection` and `ExecutiveManagementDashboardSection` now read `organization?.dashboardTheme?.hrDashboard/executiveDashboard?.metricColors` and pass `customColor` on each metric card

### **✅ DashboardPreviewPanels Component (NEW)**
- Created `frontend/src/components/reseller/DashboardPreviewPanels.tsx`
- Extracted shared components: `PhoneFrame` (iPhone-style chrome), `PhoneTopBar` (org branding + greeting), `QuotesCard`
- 3 inline mini previews: `ManagerMiniPreview`, `HRMiniPreview`, `ExecutiveMiniPreview`
- 3 full phone-frame modal previews: `ManagerPhonePreview`, `HRPhonePreview`, `ExecutivePhonePreview`

### **✅ Branding Tab Restructured**
- `ClientOrganizationManager.tsx` Dashboard Appearance section reorganized:
  - **Shared Settings** (always visible): Greeting Banner Gradient, Top Navigation Bar, Page Background, Font Family, Button Shape
  - **View Switcher Pills**: Manager / HOD | HR | Executive — 3-button segmented control
  - **Per-view controls**: Manager (action buttons + nav cards), HR (5 metric card colors), Executive (4 metric card colors)
  - Each view has inline mini preview + "Preview Full Dashboard" phone-frame modal button
- State: `dashPreviewView` (manager/hr/executive), `showDashPreview` changed from boolean to union type

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/types/core.ts` — Extended `DashboardThemeSettings`
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardShell.tsx` — `customColor` on `MetricCard`
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/HRDashboardSection.tsx` — Wired HR colors
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/ExecutiveManagementDashboardSection.tsx` — Wired Executive colors
- `frontend/src/components/reseller/DashboardPreviewPanels.tsx` — **NEW** preview components
- `frontend/src/components/reseller/ClientOrganizationManager.tsx` — Reworked branding tab UI

---

## Session 61 (2026-02-10) — Dashboard Warning Data Optimization + Staleness Detection

### **✅ Warning Data Loading Optimization**
- Added `'warnings'` to HOD and `executive_management` role requirements in `useDashboardData.ts` — warnings now loaded once per dashboard via cached `API.warnings.getAll(orgId)` call
- `FinalWarningsWatchList` accepts optional `warnings` and uses preloaded data when provided, skipping independent `API.warnings.getAll()` + `API.employees.getAll()` fetches
- All 3 dashboards (HOD, HR, Business Owner) pass preloaded `warnings` prop to `FinalWarningsWatchList`

### **✅ Wizard Preloaded Warnings**
- `UnifiedWarningWizard` accepts `preloadedWarnings` prop, filters client-side for selected employee's history instead of calling `getActiveWarnings` Cloud Function
- LRA recommendation uses preloaded warnings + provided category → `⚡⚡ FASTEST PATH` with zero Firestore queries
- Reduced LRA minimum loading skeleton from 800ms to 300ms (data is now instant client-side)

### **✅ Staleness Detection (warningsVersion)**
- `warningsVersion` counter on org document, atomically incremented (`increment(1)`) on `API.warnings.create()` and `API.warnings.update()`
- Version snapshot stored in `CacheService` (TTL: 600s) when warnings are first fetched
- On "Issue Warning" click: single `getDoc` on org doc compares `warningsVersion` with cached version
- Fresh data → open wizard instantly. Stale data → `refreshData()` before opening wizard
- Zero overhead when data is fresh (99% of the time), only re-fetches when another session created/modified warnings

### **API Calls Eliminated**
| Dashboard | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| HOD | `getAll` warnings (FinalWarningsWatchList) + `getAll` employees (FinalWarningsWatchList) + `getActiveWarnings` Cloud Function (wizard) | 1x `getAll` in useDashboardData (cached) |
| HR | `getAll` warnings (useDashboardData) + `getAll` warnings (FinalWarningsWatchList, duplicate) + `getAll` employees (FinalWarningsWatchList) | 1x `getAll` in useDashboardData (cached) |
| Business Owner | `getAll` warnings (FinalWarningsWatchList) + `getAll` employees (FinalWarningsWatchList) | 1x `getAll` in useDashboardData (cached) |

### **✅ Session Guard (Inactivity Auto-Logout + Forced App Updates)**
- `useSessionGuard` hook in `MainLayout` — tracks `touchstart`, `click`, `scroll`, `keydown`, `mousemove`
- **Inactivity timeout**: 10 minutes → `firebase.auth().signOut()` → redirect to login
- **Version check on login**: reads `system/appVersion` Firestore doc, compares with `__BUILD_VERSION__` baked into bundle
- **Version check on `visibilitychange`**: when mobile tab comes back from background, checks both inactivity AND version
- **Build system**: Vite `define` injects `__BUILD_VERSION__` (timestamp), `closeBundle` plugin writes `.build-version` marker file
- **Post-deploy script**: `scripts/post-deploy.js` reads marker file, writes version to Firestore `system/appVersion`
- **Deploy flow**: `npm run build` → `firebase deploy` → `node scripts/post-deploy.js`

### **Files Modified**
- `frontend/src/hooks/dashboard/useDashboardData.ts` — role requirements + warningsVersion snapshot
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/FinalWarningsWatchList.tsx` — accept preloaded warnings prop
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/HODDashboardSection.tsx` — pass warnings to FinalWarningsWatchList + wizard, staleness check
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/HRDashboardSection.tsx` — pass warnings to FinalWarningsWatchList
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/ExecutiveManagementDashboardSection.tsx` — pass warnings to FinalWarningsWatchList
- `frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/UnifiedWarningWizard.tsx` — preloadedWarnings prop, client-side filtering
- `frontend/src/api/index.ts` — warningsVersion bump on create/update, `isWarningsDataStale()` method
- `frontend/src/hooks/useSessionGuard.ts` — **NEW** inactivity + version check hook
- `frontend/src/layouts/MainLayout.tsx` — wired useSessionGuard
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` — `__BUILD_VERSION__` define + `.build-version` marker plugin
- `frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts` — `__BUILD_VERSION__` type declaration
- `scripts/post-deploy.js` — **NEW** post-deploy Firestore version sync

## Session 60 (2026-02-10) — Per-Organization Dashboard Theming + Mobile UX Polish

### **✅ Dashboard Theming System (Reseller-Configurable)**
- Added `DashboardThemeSettings` type to `core.ts` with fields: `actionButtons` (4 colors), `buttonShape` (flat/rounded/pill), `greetingBanner` (gradient start/end), `pageBackground`, `fontFamily`, `navCards` (teamMembers + general)
- CSS variable injection in `ThemeBrandingContext.tsx` using `setOrRemove` pattern (remove property when falsy so `var(--x, fallback)` works)
- Google Fonts dynamic loading for Poppins/Roboto/Open Sans/Nunito
- Full "Dashboard Appearance" section in `ClientOrganizationManager.tsx` Branding & CI tab with live preview + phone-frame preview
- Button shape picker, color pickers for all action buttons, greeting banner gradient, page background, font selector, nav card colors

### **✅ Dashboard Section Redesign (Team Members, Quotes, Final Warnings)**
- Replaced ThemedCard/ThemedBadge/ThemedButton with semantic elements + inline styles
- Icon medallions using background layering: `linear-gradient(rgba(255,255,255,0.88), ...), var(--color-primary)` (avoids container opacity affecting children)
- QuotesSection mobile: decorative 72px serif quote mark, clean prev/next nav
- FinalWarningsWatchList: Shield icon medallion, collapsible header, red left accent borders
- All sections consume `--dash-card-general` / `--dash-card-team-members` CSS vars
- Removed white border lines: `border: 'none'` + `boxShadow: '0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)'`
- QuotesSection renders last on all dashboards (mobile + desktop)

### **✅ MainLayout Mobile Header Polish**
- Removed `border-b`, added subtle box-shadow
- Frosted glass effect: `backdropFilter: blur(12px)`
- Avatar: enlarged to `w-8 h-8`, branded gradient background, `rounded-full` on mobile
- Touch targets: 44x44px minimum (Apple HIG/Material Design)
- Org name: `truncate` + `min-w-0` for overflow handling
- Replaced JS hover handlers with CSS `hover:opacity-90`

### **✅ Refresh App Button**
- Added "Refresh App" with `RefreshCw` icon to user dropdown (between Reset Password and Sign out)
- `window.location.reload()` — forces re-fetch of `index.html`, picks up new content-hashed bundles

### **✅ Firebase Analytics Fix**
- Wrapped `getAnalytics(app)` with `isSupported()` guard in `firebase.ts` to prevent IndexedDB warnings

### **Files Modified**
- `types/core.ts`, `ThemeBrandingContext.tsx`, `HODDashboardSection.tsx`, `WelcomeSection.tsx`, `DashboardShell.tsx`, `QuotesSection.tsx`, `FinalWarningsWatchList.tsx`, `ClientOrganizationManager.tsx`, `MainLayout.tsx`, `BusinessDashboard.tsx`, `firebase.ts`

---

## Session 59 (2026-02-09) — SignaturePadModal Redesign + Response Link + CORS Fix

### **✅ Purpose-Built SignaturePadModal (Created + Redesigned)**

**Initial implementation**: Replaced inline `SignatureModal` (~260 lines) in `UnifiedWarningWizard.tsx` with new dedicated component featuring SVG export via stroke tracking, DPI-aware canvas, `usePreventBodyScroll`, `useFocusTrap`, native touch listeners, consistent dark slate strokes (`#1e293b`).

**Root cause of persistent canvas sizing bug**: CSS rules in `modal-system.css` (lines 1714-1756) target `.enhanced-warning-wizard-container canvas` with `!important` overrides (`width: 100% !important; height: 60px !important`). Since SignaturePadModal rendered inside the wizard's DOM tree, these descendant selectors overrode all inline canvas dimension styles, stretching it visually while the internal buffer stayed tiny (only top ~10% was drawable).

**Final fix (3-layer approach)**:
1. **React Portal** — `createPortal(content, document.body)` renders modal directly on `<body>`, outside `.enhanced-warning-wizard-container`. No parent CSS descendant selectors can match.
2. **Zero className** — All elements use inline `style` props only. No Tailwind classes anywhere in the modal. No external stylesheet rules can target these elements.
3. **Viewport-based sizing** — `useLayoutEffect` synchronously computes canvas dimensions from `window.innerHeight` minus measured header/footer `offsetHeight`. No flex layout dependency, no ResizeObserver, no timing issues.

**Visual guides**: Dotted signing zone rectangle, solid baseline at 72% height, "x" start mark, "sign above the line" hint text — helps users position signature for optimal PDF rendering.

**Files**: Created `frontend/src/components/common/SignaturePadModal.tsx`, modified `UnifiedWarningWizard.tsx` (removed ~260 line inline SignatureModal + orphaned DigitalSignaturePad import), `signatureSVG.ts` (600x300 default), `PDFGenerationService.ts` (600x300 explicit)

### **✅ Response Link Button in WarningDetailsModal**
- Added Response Link button to the ACTUAL rendered action buttons section (was in dead code — `renderOverviewContent()` function never called)
- Added copy-to-clipboard response link display panel

### **✅ Cloud Functions CORS/Auth Fix**
- Added `invoker: 'public'` to all 5 public `onRequest` functions in `functions/src/employeeResponse.ts`
- Firebase Cloud Functions v2 (backed by Cloud Run) defaults to requiring authentication — `invoker: 'public'` enables unauthenticated access for the employee response/appeal pages

### **✅ Appeal Flow Comparison**
- Compared `AppealModal.tsx` (HR dashboard, authenticated) vs `EmployeeResponsePage.tsx` (public link, token-based)
- Confirmed alignment: same grounds, same fields, same Firestore schema, same notification triggers. No gaps.

## Session 58 (2026-02-03) — Gap 4 + Gap 5 Implementation

- **⏳ Gap 4: Manager Evidence Upload in Warning Wizard** — `EvidenceUploader` with `deferUpload` mode wired into Phase 2 (Incident Details). Files collected locally during wizard, uploaded to `warnings/{orgId}/{warningId}/evidence/` after save. **DEPLOYED - NEEDS TESTING**
- **⏳ Gap 5: Expected Standards Template on Categories** — `expectedStandardsTemplate` field added to `WarningCategory` type, `CategoryCustomization` (DataService), and Category Management admin form. Auto-populates Phase 4 textarea on category selection (only if empty). **DEPLOYED - NEEDS TESTING**
- **Files Modified**: `EvidenceUploader.tsx` (deferUpload prop), `IncidentDetailsForm.tsx` (evidence UI), `UnifiedWarningWizard.tsx` (state, upload, review), `WarningService.ts` + `organization.ts` (type), `DataService.ts` (merge + create), `CategoryManagement.tsx` (form field)

---

## Session 57 (2026-02-02) — Appeal & Employee Response System + PDF Viewing

### **✅ COMPLETED: All 3 HR Practitioner Feedback Gaps (Gaps 1-3) + PDF Enhancement**

**Context**: Real HR practitioner (via Adam's colleague) reviewed File and identified 3 gaps in the appeal/response system. All implemented and deployed to production.

#### Gap 3: HR Email Notification on Appeal Submission
- ✅ Created `functions/src/email/sendgridService.ts` — SendGrid wrapper using native `fetch` (Node 20)
- ✅ Created `functions/src/email/templates.ts` — HTML email templates with inline styles
- ✅ Created `functions/src/notifyHROnAppeal.ts` — Firestore trigger on `organizations/{orgId}/warnings/{warningId}`
- ✅ Fires when `appealSubmitted` flips to `true`, emails all HR managers + executive-management
- ✅ Includes employee name, warning level/category, appeal grounds, 5-working-day deadline
- ✅ Sender: `file@fifo.systems` via SendGrid API

#### Gap 2: Evidence Upload on Appeals
- ✅ Created `frontend/src/components/common/EvidenceUploader.tsx` — Reusable upload component
- ✅ Modified `AppealModal.tsx` — Added `organizationId` prop, `evidenceItems` state, `EvidenceUploader`
- ✅ Modified `ReviewDashboard.tsx` — Strips `File` objects before Firestore save, passes `organizationId`
- ✅ Modified `AppealReviewModal.tsx` — Evidence display section with thumbnails and download links
- ✅ Updated `config/storage.rules` — Rules for `appeals/` and `response-evidence/` paths
- ✅ Max 5 files, 5MB each, images + PDF + DOC/DOCX, mobile camera capture

#### Gap 1: Link-Based Employee Response & Appeal
- ✅ Created `functions/src/employeeResponse.ts` — 8 Cloud Functions:
  - `generateResponseToken` (onCall, authenticated) — 64-char hex token, 30-day expiry
  - `getWarningForResponse` (onRequest, public) — Validates token, returns warning summary + pdfAvailable
  - `getWarningPDFForResponse` (onRequest, public) — Returns signed URL for warning PDF (1hr expiry)
  - `submitEmployeeResponse` (onRequest, public) — Saves employee statement, notifies HR
  - `submitEmployeeAppeal` (onRequest, public) — Saves appeal data, triggers Firestore notification

## 🎯 PREVIOUS SESSION (2025-11-18 - Session 48)

### **✅ COMPLETED: SVG Signature System + Complete Witness Signature Support**

**Purpose**: Replace PNG signatures with SVG for 90%+ storage savings and infinite resolution. Fix witness signature data model and PDF rendering.

**Problem Identified**:
- PNG signatures were 50-200 KB each (3 signatures = 150-600 KB per warning)
- Witness signatures stored in `employee` field, causing data model confusion
- Witness signatures never appeared in PDFs (missing rendering logic)
- Fixed resolution - signatures looked pixelated when zoomed

**Solution Implemented**:

**1. SVG Signature System** (90-95% size reduction):
- ✅ Created `signatureSVG.ts` utility (231 lines) - complete SVG generation/conversion system
- ✅ `generateSVGFromStrokes()` - converts canvas stroke data to optimized SVG with smooth Bézier curves
- ✅ `convertSVGToPNG()` - canvas-based rasterization for PDF embedding (jsPDF requirement)
- ✅ `applyWitnessWatermarkToSVG()` - SVG-native watermarking (no canvas manipulation)
- ✅ Updated DigitalSignaturePad to generate SVG instead of PNG
- ✅ Updated PDFGenerationService (all 3 versions: v1.0.0, v1.1.0, v1.2.0) to convert SVG→PNG for PDF embedding
- ✅ Infinite resolution - signatures scale perfectly at any zoom level
- ✅ Professional PDF quality - crisp signatures in archived documents

**2. Witness Signature Support** (Critical Fixes):
- ✅ Fixed data model - added dedicated `witness` field to SignatureData interface
- ✅ Updated storage logic - witness signatures now saved to `witness` field (not `employee` field)
- ✅ Added witness signature rendering to PDFs - full-width box below manager/employee signatures
- ✅ Updated validation - accepts manager + (employee OR witness) instead of requiring both
- ✅ Added `witnessName` field for proper display in PDFs
- ✅ Added witness signature SVG→PNG conversion in all 3 PDF versions

**Files Modified** (11 total):
- **Created**: `signatureSVG.ts` (231 lines), `SVG_SIGNATURE_SYSTEM.md` (comprehensive documentation)
- **Updated**:
  - DigitalSignaturePad.tsx (SVG generation from strokes)
  - LegalReviewSignaturesStepV2.tsx (witness field support + storage logic)
  - EnhancedWarningWizard.tsx (witness interface + logging)
  - PDFGenerationService.ts (97 lines added for witness rendering + SVG conversion in 3 versions)
  - HODDashboardSection.tsx ("Under Development" badge on recognition button)
  - core.ts (already flexible with `signatures?: any`)

**Build & Deployment**:
- ✅ TypeScript build successful (19.21s, zero errors)
- ✅ All modules compiled without warnings
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

**Storage Savings**:
- Per signature: 50-200 KB (PNG) → 2-5 KB (SVG) = **96% reduction**
- Per warning (3 sigs): 150-600 KB → 6-15 KB = **97% reduction**
- Annual savings: **19.7 GB/year** (per 100 warnings/day)
- Cost savings: **~$3.55/year** at Firestore pricing (per 100 warnings/day)

**PDF Layout Enhancement**:
```
Manager Signature  | Employee Signature
[Manager sig]      | [Employee sig OR empty]

Witness Signature (full width, below)
[Signature with "WITNESS" watermark]
Witness Name: John Doe
Date: 2025-11-18
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Dramatic storage cost reduction (90%+ savings)
- ✅ Professional quality signatures at any zoom level
- ✅ Complete witness signature support with proper data model
- ✅ Legal compliance - witness signatures now render in PDFs
- ✅ Future-proof - SVG format supports advanced features (path editing, metadata)

**Documentation Created**:
- `SVG_SIGNATURE_SYSTEM.md` - Complete technical documentation (architecture, algorithms, code references, storage analysis)
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` - Session 48 summary, system status updated

**Status**: ✅ Production Ready - All issues resolved, comprehensive verification completed

## Previous Session (2025-10-23 - Session 36)

### **✅ COMPLETED: User Creation & Role Assignment Fix**

**Purpose**: Fix the issue where newly created users had to sign out and back in to get their roles working. Roles are now created gracefully when users are created.

**Problem Identified**:
- Backend cloud functions created Firebase Auth users and Firestore documents
- **Missing**: Custom claims were NOT set in Firebase Auth tokens
- Result: New users appeared "unauthorized" on first login, requiring sign-out/sign-in cycle

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `auth.setCustomUserClaims()` to all user creation functions
- Custom claims now include: `role`, `organizationId`, `lastUpdated`
- Set immediately after Firestore document creation

**Functions Fixed** (4 backend functions):
1. ✅ `createOrganizationUser` - HR/Business Owner creating managers (sharded architecture)
2. ✅ `createOrganizationAdmin` - Super user creating org admins (legacy architecture)
3. ✅ `createOrganizationUsers` - Bulk user creation
4. ✅ `createResellerUser` - Reseller user creation

**Files Modified**:
- `functions/src/createOrganizationUser.ts` (lines 132-142)
- `functions/src/Auth/userCreationService.ts` (3 functions updated)

**Deployment**:
- ✅ TypeScript build successful (no errors)
- ✅ All 28 Firebase Functions deployed successfully
- ✅ Live in production (us-central1 and us-east1 regions)

**Testing Guide**: See `USER_CREATION_ROLE_FIX.md` for comprehensive testing checklist

**Impact**:
- ✅ New users can login immediately without sign-out/sign-in cycle
- ✅ Roles work on first login
- ✅ Smooth onboarding experience
- ✅ Reduced support burden

**Documentation Created**:
- `USER_CREATION_ROLE_FIX.md` - Complete fix documentation with testing guide
- `AUTHENTICATION_FLOW.md` - Full authentication system documentation
- `AUTHENTICATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference for auth components
- `AUTHENTICATION_CODE_SNIPPETS.md` - Copy-paste code examples

## 🎯 SESSION 35 (2025-10-23) - DOCUMENTATION POLICY

### **✅ COMPLETED: Documentation Policy & Maintenance System**

**Purpose**: Prevent CLAUDE.md from growing uncontrollably again. Established sustainable documentation system with automatic size limits and rotation rules.

**Policy Created**: `DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md`
- **Size Limits**: CLAUDE.md max 500 lines (target: 400-470)
- **Rotation System**: Move sessions to RECENT_UPDATES.md when size > 450 lines
- **Refactor Triggers**: Automatic checks before adding new sessions
- **Content Consolidation**: Rules for keeping content concise
- **File Hierarchy**: 4-tier system (Primary → Specialized → Design → Archives)

**Implementation Complete**:
- ✅ CLAUDE.md reduced to 270 lines (79% reduction from original 1,299)
- ✅ Documentation policy references added to CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Size check command integrated: `wc -l CLAUDE.md`
