# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES - October 2, 2025

## Executive Summary

**30+ TEMP security overrides discovered in production Firestore rules that completely bypass Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).**

**Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL**
**Impact**: Any authenticated user can access/modify ANY data in the system
**Status**: Fixed in this commit

---

## Security Issues Found

### **1. Users Collection Bypass (Lines 68-69)**

**BEFORE** (INSECURE):
```javascript
allow read: if isAuthenticated() && (
  request.auth.uid == userId ||
  // TEMP: Allow any authenticated user to debug role issues
  isAuthenticated() ||  // ‚Üê BYPASS!
  isSuperUser() ||
  (isHRManager() && belongsToOrganization(resource.data.organizationId))
);
```

**Issue**: The `isAuthenticated()` condition always returns true for any logged-in user, rendering all other checks useless.

**AFTER** (SECURE):
```javascript
allow read: if isAuthenticated() && (
  request.auth.uid == userId ||
  isSuperUser() ||
  (isHRManager() && belongsToOrganization(resource.data.organizationId))
);
```

---

### **2. Organizations Collection Bypass (Lines 102-110)**

**BEFORE** (INSECURE):
```javascript
allow read: if isAuthenticated() && (
  isSuperUser() ||
  belongsToOrganization(organizationId) ||
  // TEMP: Allow any authenticated user for debugging
  isAuthenticated()  // ‚Üê BYPASS!
);

allow write: if isAuthenticated() && (
  isSuperUser() ||
  (isBusinessOwner() && belongsToOrganization(organizationId)) ||
  // TEMP: Allow any authenticated user for organization creation
  isAuthenticated()  // ‚Üê BYPASS!
);
```

**Issue**: ANY user can read/write ALL organizations' data!

**AFTER** (SECURE):
```javascript
allow read: if isAuthenticated() && (
  isSuperUser() ||
  belongsToOrganization(organizationId) ||
  resellerManagesOrganization(organizationId)
);

allow write: if isAuthenticated() && (
  isSuperUser() ||
  (isBusinessOwner() && belongsToOrganization(organizationId))
);
```

---

### **3. Sharded Users Collection Bypass (Lines 535-547)**

**BEFORE** (INSECURE):
```javascript
allow read: if isAuthenticated() && (
  isSuperUser() ||
  (belongsToOrganization(organizationId) && (
    request.auth.uid == userId || isHRManager()
  )) ||
  // TEMP: Allow during organization creation
  (isAuthenticated() && request.resource.data.role == 'business-owner') ||
  // TEMP: Allow authenticated users to read their own user document during authentication
  (isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId)  // ‚Üê BYPASS!
);
```

**Issue**: Duplicate authentication check that bypasses organization membership validation.

**AFTER** (SECURE):
```javascript
allow read: if isAuthenticated() && (
  isSuperUser() ||
  request.auth.uid == userId ||
  (belongsToOrganization(organizationId) && isHRManager())
);
```

### **4. Sharded Collections "Organization Creation" Bypass (Lines 564-647)**

**Collections Affected**:
- categories
- sectors
- warnings
- escalationRules
- settings
- meetings
- reports
- metadata documents

**BEFORE** (INSECURE):
```javascript
allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && (
  isSuperUser() ||
  (belongsToOrganization(organizationId) && isHRManager()) ||
  // TEMP: Allow during organization creation
  isAuthenticated()  // ‚Üê BYPASS!
);
```

**Issue**: The "organization creation" bypass allows ANY authenticated user to access/modify these collections at any time, not just during creation.

**AFTER** (SECURE):
```javascript
allow read: if isAuthenticated() && (
  isSuperUser() ||
  belongsToOrganization(organizationId)
);

allow write: if isAuthenticated() && (
  isSuperUser() ||
  (belongsToOrganization(organizationId) && isHRManager())
);
```

### **5. Billing System Complete Bypass (Lines 657-714)**

**Collections Affected**:
- resellers
- commissions
- commissionReports
- subscriptions
- resellerDeployments

**BEFORE** (INSECURE):
```javascript
// Resellers collection
allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && (
  isSuperUser() ||
  // TEMP: Allow any authenticated user for debugging
  isAuthenticated()  // ‚Üê BYPASS! ANY USER CAN ACCESS BILLING!
);
```

**Issue**: **CRITICAL** - Any authenticated user can:
- Read all reseller data
- Modify commission records
- Access subscription information
- View/modify financial reports

**AFTER** (SECURE):
```javascript
// Resellers collection - super user only
allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && isSuperUser();

// Commissions - super user only
allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && isSuperUser();

// Commission reports - super user and reseller access
allow read: if isAuthenticated() && (
  isSuperUser() ||
  (isReseller() && request.auth.uid == resource.data.resellerId)
);
allow write: if isAuthenticated() && isSuperUser();
```

### **6. Sharded Organization Data - COMPLETE BYPASS (Lines 764-841)**

**MOST CRITICAL - Collections with `true` bypass**:
- warnings (Line 764-772)
- categories (Line 792-800)
- meetings (Line 806-808)
- reports (Line 814-816)
- settings (Line 822-824)
- corrective_counselling (Line 830-832)
- **ALL organization data** (Line 838-841 - catch-all rule)

**BEFORE** (INSECURE):
```javascript
match /organizations/{organizationId}/categories/{categoryId} {
  allow read, list: if isAuthenticated() && (
    isSuperUser() ||
    // Any authenticated user in the organization can access categories
    true  // ‚Üê COMPLETE BYPASS!
  );

  allow write: if isAuthenticated() && (
    isSuperUser() ||
    // Any authenticated user can create/update categories in their organization
    true  // ‚Üê COMPLETE BYPASS!
  );
}

// Worst offender - catch-all bypass!
match /organizations/{organizationId}/{collection}/{document} {
  allow read, list, write: if isAuthenticated() && (
    isSuperUser() ||
    // Any authenticated user can access organization data for now (TEMP)
    true  // ‚Üê BYPASSES EVERYTHING!
  );
}
```

**Issue**: The `true` condition means literally ANY authenticated user from ANY organization can access data from ALL organizations!

**AFTER** (SECURE):
```javascript
match /organizations/{organizationId}/categories/{categoryId} {
  allow read, list: if isAuthenticated() && (
    isSuperUser() ||
    belongsToOrganization(organizationId)
  );

  allow write: if isAuthenticated() && (
    isSuperUser() ||
    (belongsToOrganization(organizationId) && isHRManager())
  );
}

// Catch-all rule removed - specific rules for each collection type
```

## Impact Assessment

### **Data Exposed**:
1. ‚úÖ All user records across all organizations
2. ‚úÖ All organization settings and configurations
3. ‚úÖ All employee records
4. ‚úÖ All warnings and disciplinary records
5. ‚úÖ All financial data (commissions, billing, subscriptions)
6. ‚úÖ All meeting, absence, and counselling records
7. ‚úÖ All categories, sectors, and escalation rules

### **Unauthorized Actions Possible**:
- Read sensitive employee disciplinary records from any organization
- Modify warning categories across organizations
- Access financial/commission data
- Create/modify organization settings
- Read/write to ANY sharded collection

### **Compliance Impact**:
- ‚ùå GDPR violation (unauthorized data access)
- ‚ùå POPIA violation (South African data protection)
- ‚ùå Labor law violation (employee privacy)
- ‚ùå Failed security audit requirements

## Fix Strategy

### **1. Remove ALL TEMP Bypasses**
- Remove 30+ `isAuthenticated()` duplicate checks
- Remove `true` conditions
- Remove "debugging" bypasses
- Remove "organization creation" blanket allowances

### **2. Implement Proper RBAC**
Each collection now has strict access control:

| Collection | Read Access | Write Access |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Users | Self + HR (same org) + Super User | Self + Business Owner (same org) + Super User |
| Organizations | Org members + Reseller (managed) + Super User | Business Owner (same org) + Super User |
| Employees | Org members + Reseller (managed) + Super User | HR (same org) + Super User |
| Warnings | Org members + Reseller (managed) + Super User | Managers (same org) + Super User |
| Billing | Super User only | Super User only |
| Commission Reports | Super User + Reseller (own reports) | Super User only |

### **3. Organization Creation - Proper Implementation**
Instead of bypassing security, organization creation now:
1. Uses Cloud Functions with elevated privileges
2. Sets proper user custom claims immediately
3. User gains access AFTER claims are set
4. No security bypass needed

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] User A from Org 1 CANNOT read users from Org 2
- [ ] User A from Org 1 CANNOT read warnings from Org 2
- [ ] HR Manager can read employees in their org only
- [ ] Business Owner can create users in their org only
- [ ] Regular users CANNOT access billing data
- [ ] Resellers can read commission reports for THEIR deployments only
- [ ] Super User retains full access
- [ ] Organization creation via wizard still works
- [ ] User creation by Business Owner still works

## Deployment Steps

1. ‚úÖ Backup existing rules ‚Üí `firestore.rules.backup`
2. ‚è≥ Apply fixed rules ‚Üí `firestore.rules`
3. ‚è≥ Deploy to Firebase ‚Üí `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
4. ‚è≥ Monitor error logs for 24 hours
5. ‚è≥ Run security test suite
6. ‚è≥ Update SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md

---

## Files Changed

- `/config/firestore.rules` - Complete security fix
- `/config/firestore.rules.backup` - Original (insecure) rules
- `/SECURITY_FIXES_2025-10-02.md` - This document

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never use TEMP overrides in production** - Create feature flags or separate dev/prod rules instead
2. **Avoid duplicate authentication checks** - The first `isAuthenticated()` makes subsequent ones redundant
3. **Never use `true` as a condition** - It bypasses all security
4. **Test security rules thoroughly** - Firebase Emulator can catch these issues early
5. **Regular security audits** - Monthly review of rules for bypasses

---

## Next Steps

1. Deploy fixed rules immediately
2. Monitor for any broken functionality
3. Add security rule testing to CI/CD
4. Create dev/staging Firebase projects for testing

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - Ready for deployment
**Approval Required**: Yes - Critical production change
**Rollback Plan**: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` using backup file
