# üì¶ Legacy Components Archive

This folder contains **deprecated/replaced components** that are no longer used in the application but are preserved for reference.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Build Exclusion

These components are **excluded from production builds** via `vite.config.ts` to reduce bundle size.

## Why Keep Legacy Components?

1. **Reference Implementation** - See how features were originally built
2. **Migration Assistance** - Understand what changed between V1 and V2
3. **Code Examples** - Reusable patterns and logic
4. **Rollback Safety** - Quick restoration if needed

## Restoring a Legacy Component

If you need to restore a component:

1. **Copy from `_legacy/` to original location**
   ```bash
   cp src/_legacy/dashboard/UnifiedHODDashboardSection.tsx src/components/dashboard/
   ```

2. **Update imports** in files that use it

3. **Remove from `_legacy/`** if permanently restored

## Maintenance

- **Never import** from `_legacy/` in production code
- **Update this README** when archiving new components
- **Review quarterly** - delete truly obsolete components after 6 months
