                        ABC MANUFACTURING (PTY) LTD
                           DISCIPLINARY WARNING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Valid for 3 months | Expires: 15 March 2026

Issued in terms of: Annexure B: Disciplinary Code 2022


EMPLOYEE DETAILS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Name:               John Smith
Employee Number:    EMP-2024-001
Position:           Machine Operator
Department:         Production
Date of Issue:      15 December 2025


WARNING DETAILS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Warning Level:      Verbal Warning
Category:           Attendance - Tardiness
Incident Date:      12 December 2025
Incident Time:      08:47
Location:           Production Floor, Main Entrance


(A) DETAILS AND NATURE OF MISCONDUCT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
On 12 December 2025 at 08:47, you arrived 47 minutes late for your
scheduled shift which was due to commence at 08:00. This is the third
instance of late arrival within the past two weeks (previously late on
5 December and 8 December). Your tardiness disrupted the production
line handover and required your supervisor to cover your station until
your arrival.

You did not provide advance notice of your late arrival, nor did you
have a valid reason for the delay. When questioned, you stated you
"overslept and traffic was bad" but could not provide any evidence of
unusual traffic conditions on that route at that time.

This behavior violates Company Policy 4.2.1 (Punctuality and
Attendance) which requires all employees to arrive at their workstation
ready to begin work at their scheduled start time.


(B) EMPLOYEE'S VERSION OF EVENTS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The employee acknowledged arriving late on 12 December 2025. He
explained that he has been experiencing difficulty waking up on time
due to his alarm clock malfunctioning. He stated that traffic was
heavier than normal on the N1 highway that morning.

The employee admitted he should have called to notify his supervisor
when he realized he would be late, but he was already running behind
and didn't want to waste more time. He apologized for the disruption
caused to the production line and acknowledged that his tardiness
affected his team members who had to cover his duties.

The employee expressed understanding that his repeated lateness is
unacceptable and committed to taking corrective action to improve his
punctuality.


(C) REQUIRED/EXPECTED BEHAVIOR & STANDARDS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
As an employee of ABC Manufacturing, you are required to:

1. Arrive at your designated workstation by your scheduled start time
   (08:00 for your shift), ready to commence work immediately.

2. Notify your direct supervisor at least 1 hour in advance if you will
   be late or absent due to unforeseen circumstances.

3. Maintain a consistent attendance record in accordance with Company
   Policy 4.2.1, which states that employees should have no more than
   2 unexcused late arrivals per quarter.

4. Take personal responsibility for time management, including setting
   appropriate alarms, planning travel time accounting for potential
   delays, and arranging backup transportation options.

5. Demonstrate professionalism and reliability as these are core values
   of ABC Manufacturing and essential for maintaining production
   schedules and team efficiency.

Punctuality is critical in a manufacturing environment where production
lines depend on full staffing at shift changeover times. Your role
directly impacts the entire team's ability to meet production targets.


(E) FACTS LEADING TO DECISION TAKEN
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This verbal warning has been issued based on the following facts:

1. PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR: Three late arrivals within 14 days (5 Dec,
   8 Dec, 12 Dec) demonstrates a pattern rather than an isolated
   incident.

2. IMPACT ON OPERATIONS: Each late arrival disrupted production line
   handover, requiring supervisor intervention and overtime coverage.

3. LACK OF COMMUNICATION: Employee failed to notify supervisor in
   advance on any of the three occasions.

4. ABSENCE OF MITIGATING FACTORS: No documented emergency, no evidence
   of unforeseen circumstances beyond employee's control.

5. PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE: As this is a first formal disciplinary
   action for attendance issues, a verbal warning is appropriate under
   our progressive discipline policy.

6. EMPLOYEE'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT: Employee admitted fault and expressed
   willingness to improve, indicating corrective action may be effective.

Given that this is a first formal warning and the employee has
acknowledged the problem and committed to improvement, a verbal warning
is deemed proportionate. However, any further attendance issues within
the next 3 months will result in escalation to a written warning.


(F) ACTION STEPS & IMPROVEMENT COMMITMENTS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The employee has committed to the following specific actions to improve
conduct and performance:

1. Purchase a new reliable alarm clock and set multiple alarms (primary
   alarm at 06:00, backup alarm at 06:15) to ensure timely wake-up.
   Timeline: Within 3 days

2. Leave home 15 minutes earlier (by 07:00 instead of 07:15) to build
   in buffer time for potential traffic delays on commute.
   Timeline: Starting immediately (next shift on 16 December)

3. Notify supervisor by phone at least 1 hour in advance if any
   unforeseen delay occurs, providing estimated arrival time.
   Timeline: Ongoing requirement

4. Maintain 100% punctuality (no late arrivals) for the next 90 days
   during the warning validity period.
   Timeline: 15 December 2025 - 15 March 2026


FOLLOW-UP REVIEW
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Follow-up Review Date:     15 January 2026

A follow-up meeting will be conducted on 15 January 2026 to review the
employee's progress on the improvement commitments above. The supervisor
will assess attendance records for the 30-day period and confirm whether
the corrective actions have been implemented successfully.


TRAINING & SUPPORT PROVIDED
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The following support has been provided to assist the employee:

- Time management coaching session with supervisor (15 minutes)
- Explained Company Policy 4.2.1 in detail
- Discussed strategies for maintaining punctuality
- Employee was given supervisor's direct mobile number for emergency
  notifications


RESOURCES PROVIDED
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Company Policy Manual (Section 4.2: Attendance & Punctuality)
- Emergency Contact List (Supervisor contact numbers)
- Shift Schedule (December 2025 - March 2026)


CONSEQUENCES & ESCALATION PATH
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Validity Period: This warning is valid for 3 months from date of issue
(expires 15 March 2026).

All unexpired warnings accumulate and may result in further disciplinary
action. The standard escalation path for this category is:

  Verbal → Written → Final Written → Ending of Service

Should you receive another warning for this or any other category while
this warning is active, it will be taken into account and may result in
more severe disciplinary action up to and including ending of service.

## Storage Impact

### Field Size Estimates:

- `employeeStatement`: 200-500 chars avg (1-2 paragraphs)
- `expectedBehavior`: 300-600 chars avg (2-3 paragraphs)
- `factsAndReasoning`: 300-700 chars avg (2-4 paragraphs)
- `actionCommitments`: 200-400 chars avg (2-4 commitments × 50-100 chars each)

- `resourcesProvided`: 50-150 chars avg (optional array)

**Total Additional Storage per Warning**: ~1,150 - 2,650 characters (~1-3 KB)

This is well within Firestore's 1MB document size limit and won't impact performance.

## Backward Compatibility

### Existing Warnings (without corrective discussion):

- No corrective discussion sections will appear
- PDFs remain legally identical to original issue

### New Warnings (with corrective discussion):
- Will generate PDFs using v1.2.0
- All corrective discussion sections appear
- If optional fields are empty, sections gracefully omit

### Mixed Organization (some users upgrade, others don't):
