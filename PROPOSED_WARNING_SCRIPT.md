## 🇬🇧 ENGLISH - Proposed Streamlined Script

### **1. Opening**
```
{employeeName}, this meeting is to formalize the written warning for the workplace incident we discussed.
```

**Current**: 23 words
**Proposed**: 17 words
**Change**: Removed "as we've discussed" (redundant), "regarding the workplace incident that occurred" (verbose)

---

### **2. Incident Details**
```
Charge: {categoryName}
Details: {description}
This behavior violates our workplace policies and must stop immediately.
```

**Current**: ~40 words ("To recap what we discussed earlier... This behavior is not acceptable under our workplace standards and company policies, and it must be corrected immediately.")
**Proposed**: ~18 words
**Change**: Removed "To recap what we discussed earlier" (unnecessary backstory), added clear charge/details structure, simplified policy language

---

### **3. Warning Level & Validity**
```
This is a {warning level}. It remains on your record for {validityPeriod} months. You must demonstrate immediate and sustained improvement.
```

**Current**: ~45 words
**Proposed**: ~20 words
**Change**: Combined sentences, removed "from today's date" (obvious), removed "During this validity period, you are expected to..." (wordy)

---

### **4. Your Rights**
```
Your rights under the Labour Relations Act:
```

**Current**: "Now, it's very important that you understand your rights:" (10 words)
**Proposed**: 6 words
**Change**: Direct, professional, references LRA explicitly

**Rights List**:
- **Appeal**: You may appeal this warning in writing to HR within 48 hours if you believe it is unfair or procedurally incorrect.
- **Progressive Discipline**: Similar conduct during this warning's validity period may result in further disciplinary action, up to dismissal.
- **Confidentiality**: This information is confidential and shared only with relevant management and HR.

**Current**: 80 words (3 long sentences)
**Proposed**: ~55 words (3 concise bullets)
**Change**: Removed "CCMA access" (not required in initial warning, employee can find this in appeal process), simplified language

---

### **5. Signature Explanation**
```
Your signature confirms you understand this warning and your rights - not that you agree with it. If you refuse to sign, a witness will confirm the warning was explained. The warning is valid either way.
```

**Current**: 89 words (5 long sentences with excessive hand-holding)
**Proposed**: 38 words (3 clear sentences)
**Change**: 57% reduction. Removed:
- "that is your right" (patronizing)
- "in your presence" (obvious)
- "properly notified" vs "simply confirms" (redundant phrasing)
- "regardless of whether..." (wordy conditional)

---

### **6. Questions & Closing**
```
Do you have any questions about this warning or your rights?

[After questions]

We will now collect signatures. Immediate improvement is required.
```

**Current Questions**: ~30 words ("Do you have any questions about this warning, the validity period, the consequences, or your rights? I want to make sure you fully understand everything before we proceed with signatures.")
**Proposed**: 11 words
**Change**: Removed list of things they can ask about (obvious), removed "I want to make sure..." (patronizing)

**Current Closing**: ~40 words ("Thank you. We will now proceed to collect signatures to formalize this warning. Remember, this is an opportunity for you to correct your conduct. We expect to see immediate improvement, and we hope this will be the end of this matter.")
**Proposed**: 9 words
**Change**: Removed:
- "Thank you" (unnecessary pleasantries)
- "to formalize this warning" (obvious)
- "Remember, this is an opportunity..." (lecturing)
- "we hope this will be the end..." (wishful thinking, unprofessional)

---

## 📝 REMOVED SECTIONS

### ❌ Section 2: "Meeting Purpose" (DELETED)
**Reason**: Meta-commentary. Don't explain what you're about to do - just do it.

**What it said**:
> "We've already covered the details of what happened. Now I need to formally explain the warning level, the validity period, your rights, and the consequences if similar behavior occurs again. This process follows the Labour Relations Act and our company's disciplinary policy."

**Why it's gone**:
- "We've already covered..." - Backstory, not needed
- "Now I need to formally explain..." - You're literally doing that in the next sections
- "This process follows the LRA..." - State this in the rights section where it matters
