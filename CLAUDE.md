# CLAUDE.md

This file provides essential guidance to Claude Code when working with this HR Disciplinary System repository.

## Quick Start

### Development Commands
```bash
# Frontend development
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Build with extended timeout (handles 2081+ modules)
npm run build --timeout 300000

# Firebase emulators (all services)
firebase emulators:start

# Deploy to production
firebase deploy

# Create system backup (protects against accidental code deletion)
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S") && cp -r /home/aiguy/projects/hr-disciplinary-system "$HOME/hr-system-backups/hr-system-$TIMESTAMP" && echo "‚úÖ Backup created: hr-system-$TIMESTAMP"

# Git-based incremental auto-backup (Claude runs after every edit)
git add . && git commit -m "Auto-backup: $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - File edit protection" && echo "üîÑ Incremental backup completed"
```

### Current System Status
- **‚úÖ Production**: Online at https://hr-disciplinary-system.web.app
- **‚úÖ Development**: Ubuntu environment at http://localhost:3001/ (auto-port switch from 3000)
- **‚úÖ Design System**: Complete SuperUser premium styling across all interfaces
- **‚úÖ Enterprise Readiness**: A-grade security, production monitoring, 2,700+ org scalability
- **‚úÖ Sharded Architecture**: Database sharding implemented for multi-thousand organization support
- **‚úÖ V2 Components**: HOD Dashboard actions (Issue Warning, Book HR Meeting, Report Absence) fully upgraded to V2 standards
- **‚úÖ Employee Archive System**: Complete employee lifecycle management with archive/restore functionality
- **‚úÖ Git Backup System**: Incremental backups after every file edit with unlimited version history

## Architecture Summary
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions + Firestore + Storage
- **Firebase Regions**: 
  - **Primary**: `us-central1` (most functions, main server)
  - **Secondary**: `us-east1` (super user functions only - new server)
- **Key Features**: Multi-sector HR management, role-based access, real-time notifications, QR code document delivery

## Development Workflow
1. **Code Changes**: Use existing patterns and design system
2. **Testing**: Manual testing preferred for development efficiency
   - E2E Playwright framework available: `npm run test:e2e` (use only when specifically requested)
   - Firebase emulator testing: `npm run test:firebase` 
   - Organization creation E2E test: `frontend/src/e2e/organization-creation.spec.ts` (available but not actively used)
3. **Builds**: Allow 5+ minutes for full production builds
4. **Never commit**: Unless explicitly requested by user
5. **üö´ FIRESTORE INDEXES**: Never programmatically deploy indexes via firebase.json - user creates them manually in Firebase Console using error links
6. **üö´ STRIPE.JS CONSOLE ERRORS**: Ignore Stripe.js COEP (Cross-Origin Embedder Policy) console errors - they're expected during development and don't affect functionality

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Firebase Functions Deployment Regions

### **Server Migration Status**
- **PRIMARY SERVER: `us-central1`** - Main deployment region (most functions)
- **SECONDARY SERVER: `us-east1`** - New server (super user functions only)

### **Frontend Configuration**
- **Current**: `frontend/src/config/firebase.ts` uses `us-central1` 
- **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Only change region if deploying to different server
- **Rule**: Always match frontend region with target function's deployment region

### **Deployment Guidelines**
- **Default**: Deploy new functions to `us-central1` (primary server)
- **Exception**: Super user functions go to `us-east1` (new server)
- **Verification**: Run `firebase functions:list` to confirm deployment region
- **Frontend Update**: Update `getFunctions(app, 'REGION')` if deploying to different region

### **Current Function Distribution**
```bash
us-central1: Most functions (reseller, organization, auth, billing, audio, etc.)
us-east1:    getSuperUserInfo, manageSuperUser (super user functions only)
```

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIX (2025-09-18)

### Issue: User Creation Race Condition & Console Noise - FIXED
**Problem**: When creating organizations as a reseller:
- AuthContext immediately searched for newly created users before document was ready
- Console showed "User profile not found" errors during organization creation
- Excessive debug logging ("Steps configuration" logged 100+ times)

**Root Cause**:
- Race condition between Firebase Auth user creation and Firestore document creation
- Debug logging in useEffect hooks firing on every re-render

### Changes Made
1. **‚úÖ Updated ShardedOrganizationService.ts**:
   - Added `userCreationManager` to track pending user creation
   - Calls `startUserCreation()` when creating Firebase Auth user
   - Calls `finishUserCreation()` after Firestore document is created
   - Proper cleanup in error handling
   - **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed duplicate `userId` declaration that caused "Cannot access before initialization" error

2. **‚úÖ Updated AuthContext.tsx**:
   - Checks `userCreationManager.isPendingUser()` before showing errors
   - Shows "User creation in progress" message instead of error
   - Retries finding user after 2-second delay for pending users
   - Prevents false "User not found" errors during creation

3. **‚úÖ Cleaned Console Output**:
   - Commented out excessive "Steps configuration" debug logging
   - Commented out "User role detection" debug logging
   - Commented out "Loaded resellers" debug logging
   - Console now shows only essential operational logs

### Expected Result
- Organization creation works smoothly without error messages
- No more "User profile not found" errors during user creation
- Clean console output with only relevant information
- Proper handling of the async user creation flow

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED ENHANCEMENT (2025-09-18)

### Enhancement: Full CRUD for Warning Categories in Organization Wizard - IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: Organization wizard only allowed adding custom categories, no management of default categories
- Users could only see "Add Custom Category" button
- No list of existing/default categories displayed
- No ability to edit or delete default SA labor law categories

**Root Cause**:
- `getDefaultCategories()` function returned empty array `[]`
- CategoryEditor had restrictions preventing editing of default categories
- Delete functionality was disabled for default categories

### Changes Made
1. **‚úÖ Fixed Default Categories Display**:
   - Updated `getDefaultCategories()` to return actual UNIVERSAL_SA_CATEGORIES
   - Added proper import of UniversalCategories service
   - Converted UniversalCategory format to OrganizationCategory format
   - Added severity-based color coding (green/amber/red)

2. **‚úÖ Enabled Full CRUD for All Categories**:
   - Removed `disabled={localCategory.isDefault}` restrictions on all input fields
   - Removed conditional rendering that hid delete button for default categories
   - Updated delete handler to allow removal of any category (default or custom)
   - Added helpful tooltips distinguishing default vs custom categories

3. **‚úÖ Enhanced Category Management Features**:
   - ‚úÖ **Create**: Add new custom categories with full configuration
   - ‚úÖ **Read**: Display all 8 default SA labor law categories + custom ones
   - ‚úÖ **Update**: Edit name, description, escalation path, colors, and settings for ANY category
   - ‚úÖ **Delete**: Remove any category (including defaults) if not needed
   - ‚úÖ **Escalation Path Editor**: Move, duplicate, add, remove escalation steps
   - ‚úÖ **Expand/Collapse**: Detailed category editing with full configuration options

### Expected Result
- Organization wizard now shows complete category management on "Customization" step
- Users can see all 8 default SA labor law categories with full details
- Full CRUD operations available for both default and custom categories
- Categories display with proper color coding and escalation paths
- Comprehensive category customization for each organization's specific needs

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIX (2025-09-18)

### Issue: Modal Z-Index Layering Issues on Business Owner Dashboard - FIXED
**Problem**: When clicking "Add HR Manager" or "Add Department Manager" buttons:
- Modals rendered behind the Warning Overview & Insights container
- Modal content was not visible or partially obscured
- Z-index conflicts caused by nested component stacking contexts

**Root Cause**:
- Modals were rendered within their parent components' DOM hierarchy
- Parent containers had `relative` positioning creating stacking contexts
- Warning Overview section had `relative z-10` that interfered with modal display
- Modal z-index values were constrained by parent stacking contexts

### Changes Made
1. **‚úÖ Added React Portal Support**:
   - Added `createPortal` import to BusinessOwnerDashboardSection
   - Added `createPortal` import to OrganizationManagementV2
   - Portal renders modals directly to document.body

2. **‚úÖ Fixed Employee Management Modal**:
   - Updated modal rendering to use `createPortal(modal, document.body)`
   - Increased z-index to `z-[9999]` for maximum stacking priority
   - Modal now renders at top-level DOM, avoiding parent container constraints

3. **‚úÖ Fixed Add User Modal (HR/Department Managers)**:
   - Wrapped AddUserModal component with `createPortal`
   - Modal now renders to document.body instead of within component hierarchy
   - Conditional rendering ensures portal only creates when modal is shown

### Expected Result
- All modals on Business Owner Dashboard now render above all content
- "Add HR Manager" and "Add Department Manager" buttons work properly
- Employee Management modal displays correctly above Warning Overview
- No more z-index conflicts or hidden modal content
- Modals properly overlay the entire viewport with backdrop blur

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIX (2025-09-16)

### Issue: Organization Creation Duplicate Categories - FIXED
**Problem**: Organization wizard creating 10 categories instead of expected 8
- **Root Cause**: ShardedOrganizationService using old 5-category system instead of UniversalCategories
- **Fix Applied**: Updated ShardedOrganizationService to use UniversalCategories as single source of truth

### Changes Made
1. **‚úÖ Updated ShardedOrganizationService.ts**:
   - Added import of `UNIVERSAL_SA_CATEGORIES` from UniversalCategories.ts
   - Replaced old 5-category hardcoded system with proper UniversalCategories integration
   - Now creates all 8 comprehensive SA labor law categories with full metadata
   - Maintains backward compatibility for custom categories

2. **‚úÖ Proper Category Structure**:
   - Now uses severity levels (minor, serious, gross_misconduct)
   - Includes complete escalation paths for each category
   - Preserves LRA compliance metadata and legal references
   - Color coding based on severity levels

### Expected Result
- New organizations will now create exactly 8 categories from UniversalCategories
- No more duplication issues
- Full SA labor law compliance with comprehensive category system

### Testing Required
- Test organization creation to verify 8 categories are created (not 10)
- Verify all categories have proper escalation paths and metadata
