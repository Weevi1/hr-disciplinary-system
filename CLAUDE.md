# CLAUDE.md

Essential guidance for Claude Code when working with this HR Disciplinary System repository.

---

## Quick Start

### Development Commands
```bash
# Frontend development
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Build with extended timeout (handles 2081+ modules)
npm run build --timeout 300000

# Firebase emulators (all services)
firebase emulators:start

# Deploy to production
firebase deploy
```

### Current System Status
- **‚úÖ Production**: Online at https://hr-disciplinary-system.web.app
- **‚úÖ Development**: Ubuntu environment at http://localhost:3003/ (dev server running)
- **‚úÖ Enterprise Ready**: A-grade security, production monitoring, 2,700+ org scalability
- **‚úÖ Sharded Architecture**: Database sharding implemented for multi-thousand organization support
- **‚úÖ Progressive Enhancement**: Complete 2012-2025 device compatibility with zero performance punishment
- **‚úÖ Unified Design System**: Complete visual unification with consistent typography, spacing, and theming
- **‚úÖ Unified Admin Dashboards**: Business Owner, HR, and SuperAdmin dashboards follow identical structure - Greeting ‚Üí Metrics ‚Üí Tabs ‚Üí Quote

---

## Architecture Summary

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions + Firestore + Storage
- **Firebase Regions**:
  - **Primary**: `us-central1` (most functions, main server)
  - **Secondary**: `us-east1` (super user functions only - new server)
- **Key Features**: Multi-sector HR management, multi-manager employee assignments, role-based access, real-time notifications, QR code document delivery

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Code Changes**: Use existing patterns and design system
2. **Testing**: Manual testing preferred for development efficiency
   - E2E Playwright framework available: `npm run test:e2e` (use only when specifically requested)
   - Firebase emulator testing: `npm run test:firebase`
3. **Builds**: Allow 5+ minutes for full production builds
4. **Never commit**: Unless explicitly requested by user
5. **üö´ FIRESTORE INDEXES**: Never programmatically deploy indexes via firebase.json - user creates them manually in Firebase Console using error links

### üìè Documentation Maintenance

**IMPORTANT**: This file is size-limited to maintain context efficiency.

- **Size Limit**: 500 lines maximum (target: 400-470 lines)
- **Current Size**: 270 lines ‚úÖ
- **Policy**: See `DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md` for complete maintenance rules
- **Before Adding Sessions**: Check size with `wc -l CLAUDE.md`
- **If > 450 lines**: Move previous session to RECENT_UPDATES.md first

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Firebase Functions Deployment Regions

### **Server Configuration**
- **PRIMARY SERVER: `us-central1`** - Main deployment region (most functions)
- **SECONDARY SERVER: `us-east1`** - New server (super user functions only)

### **Frontend Configuration**
- **Current**: `frontend/src/config/firebase.ts` uses `us-central1`
- **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Only change region if deploying to different server
- **Rule**: Always match frontend region with target function's deployment region

### **Current Function Distribution**
```bash
us-central1: Most functions (reseller, organization, auth, billing, audio, etc.)
us-east1:    getSuperUserInfo, manageSuperUser (super user functions only)
```

## Important Files

**For complete file locations catalog with descriptions, see `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`**

### Key Files to Know
- **Core Types**: `frontend/src/types/core.ts`, `frontend/src/types/employee.ts`
- **PDF System**: `PDFGenerationService.ts`, `PDFTemplateVersionService.ts`, `pdfDataTransformer.ts` - See `PDF_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Services**: `DatabaseShardingService.ts`, `EmployeeService.ts`, `WarningService.ts`
- **Design System**: `ThemedCard.tsx`, `UnifiedModal.tsx`, `index.css` (1,328 lines of progressive enhancement CSS)
- **Hooks**: `useDashboardData.ts`, `usePreventBodyScroll.ts`, `useFocusTrap.ts`

---

## Critical Operational Guidelines

### **üö´ NEVER DO**
- **Never commit** unless explicitly requested
- **Never update git config**
- **Never use git commands with -i flag** (interactive input not supported)
- **Never programmatically deploy Firestore indexes** - user creates manually via console
- **Never push to remote** unless user explicitly asks

### **‚úÖ ALWAYS DO**
- Use existing patterns and design system
- Check for similar code in components before adding new code
- Run lint and typecheck commands after significant changes if available
- Use absolute file paths in tools
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Use defensive programming with null checks

### **Development Server Status**
- **Current**: Running at http://localhost:3003/
- **Status**: Fully optimized for 2012-era devices with progressive enhancement
- **Compatibility**: 95% compatible with Android 4.0+ and iOS 6+ devices
- **‚úÖ Mobile Dashboard**: Samsung S8 era mobile optimizations implemented
- **‚úÖ Mobile Layout**: MainLayout header optimized - removed hamburger menu, consolidated navigation into profile dropdown
- **‚úÖ Mobile Components**: Created MobileEmployeeManagement component with dedicated mobile UX patterns

## PDF Systems Overview

**For complete PDF system documentation, see `PDF_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`**

The system uses a 3-layer architecture for legal compliance and organizational flexibility:

1. **PDF Generator Versioning** (v1.0.0 [FROZEN], v1.1.0 [CURRENT])
   - Ensures historical warnings regenerate identically for legal compliance
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Never modify frozen version methods
   - See `PDFGenerationService.ts` for version routing

2. **PDF Template Customization** (Per-Organization Styling)
   - Each organization can have unique PDF branding (colors, fonts, logos)
   - Maintains same code version for legal consistency
   - See `PDFTemplateManager.tsx`, `PDFTemplateEditor.tsx`

3. **PDF Template Version Storage** (1000x Storage Reduction)
   - Centralized template storage prevents duplication
   - Warnings store 5-byte version reference instead of 5-10KB settings object
   - See `PDFTemplateVersionService.ts`

**Key Pattern**: `generateWarningPDF(data, codeVersion, templateSettings)`
