## Architecture Summary

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions + Firestore + Storage
- **Firebase Regions**:
  - **Primary**: `us-central1` (most functions, main server)
  - **Secondary**: `us-east1` (super user functions only - new server)
- **Key Features**: Multi-sector HR management, role-based access, real-time notifications, QR code document delivery

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Code Changes**: Use existing patterns and design system
2. **Testing**: Manual testing preferred for development efficiency
   - E2E Playwright framework available: `npm run test:e2e` (use only when specifically requested)
   - Firebase emulator testing: `npm run test:firebase`
3. **Builds**: Allow 5+ minutes for full production builds
4. **Never commit**: Unless explicitly requested by user
5. **üö´ FIRESTORE INDEXES**: Never programmatically deploy indexes via firebase.json - user creates them manually in Firebase Console using error links

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Firebase Functions Deployment Regions

### **Server Configuration**
- **PRIMARY SERVER: `us-central1`** - Main deployment region (most functions)
- **SECONDARY SERVER: `us-east1`** - New server (super user functions only)

### **Frontend Configuration**
- **Current**: `frontend/src/config/firebase.ts` uses `us-central1`
- **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Only change region if deploying to different server
- **Rule**: Always match frontend region with target function's deployment region

### **Current Function Distribution**
```bash
us-central1: Most functions (reseller, organization, auth, billing, audio, etc.)
us-east1:    getSuperUserInfo, manageSuperUser (super user functions only)
```

## üîí PDF Generator Versioning System - SECURITY CRITICAL

### **Overview**

The PDF generation system uses semantic versioning to ensure **legal compliance** and **document integrity**. Historical warnings must regenerate **identically** years later for appeals, audits, or legal proceedings.

### **‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: NEVER MODIFY FROZEN VERSIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Frozen versions** are PERMANENTLY LOCKED and must **NEVER** be changed. Modifying them breaks legal document integrity and could invalidate historical warnings in court.

### **Current Version Status**

- **v1.0.0** - [FROZEN] - Used by warnings created before 2025-10-14
  - Previous Action shows: `Date | Offense | Level`
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT MODIFY** `generateWarningPDF_v1_0_0()` or `addPreviousDisciplinaryActionSection_v1_0_0()`

- **v1.1.0** - [CURRENT] - Used by all new warnings
  - Previous Action shows: `Date | Incident Description | Level`
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Will become FROZEN when v1.2.0 is released

### **How It Works**

1. **New Warnings**: Store `pdfGeneratorVersion: '1.1.0'` in Firestore when created
2. **Regeneration**: Read stored version from Firestore, route to correct version handler
3. **Consistency**: Old warnings use v1.0.0 code, new warnings use v1.1.0 code
4. **Legal Compliance**: PDFs always look identical regardless of when regenerated

### **Key Files**

- **`frontend/src/services/PDFGenerationService.ts`**
  - Main entry point: `generateWarningPDF(data, requestedVersion)`
  - Version routing switch (lines 206-228)
  - Frozen methods: `generateWarningPDF_v1_0_0()`, `addPreviousDisciplinaryActionSection_v1_0_0()`
  - Current method: `generateWarningPDF_v1_1_0()`
  - **100+ lines of protective comments**

- **`frontend/src/utils/pdfDataTransformer.ts`**
  - `transformWarningDataForPDF()` - Adds `pdfGeneratorVersion` to all PDFs
  - Single source of truth for data transformation

- **`frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/EnhancedWarningWizard.tsx`**
  - Stores `pdfGeneratorVersion` when creating warnings (line 887)
  - 27 lines of comprehensive comments explaining system

### **Updated Components (All pass stored version)**

All 6 PDF regeneration points now pass the stored version:
1. `SimplePDFDownloadModal.tsx` (line 212-215)
2. `PDFPreviewModal.tsx` (line 219-222)
3. `PrintDeliveryGuide.tsx` (line 149-152)
4. `DeliveryCompletionStep.tsx` (line 275-278)
5. `ProofOfDeliveryModal.tsx` (line 279-282)
6. `PDFViewerModal.tsx` (line 184-187)

### **üö´ DO NOT:**

- Modify `generateWarningPDF_v1_0_0()` method
- Modify `addPreviousDisciplinaryActionSection_v1_0_0()` method
- Change format strings in frozen versions (e.g., line 865 in v1.0.0)
- "Fix bugs" in frozen versions
- Remove cases from version routing switch
- Modify `generateWarningPDF_v1_1_0()` once it becomes frozen

### **‚úÖ HOW TO ADD A NEW VERSION (e.g., v1.2.0):**

1. **Increment Version**: Update `PDF_GENERATOR_VERSION` in `PDFGenerationService.ts` (line 63)
   ```typescript
   export const PDF_GENERATOR_VERSION = '1.2.0'; // Changed from 1.1.0
   ```

2. **Create New Method**: Copy v1.1.0 method and create `generateWarningPDF_v1_2_0()`
   ```typescript
   private static async generateWarningPDF_v1_2_0(data: WarningPDFData): Promise<Blob> {
     // Your new implementation
   }
   ```

3. **Create New Format Method** (if format changed):
   ```typescript
   private static addPreviousDisciplinaryActionSection_v1_2_0(...) {
     // Your new format
   }
   ```

4. **Update Version Routing** (add new case, KEEP all old ones):
   ```typescript
   switch (version) {
     case '1.0.0':
       return this.generateWarningPDF_v1_0_0(data);
     case '1.1.0':
       return this.generateWarningPDF_v1_1_0(data);
     case '1.2.0':  // ADD THIS
       return this.generateWarningPDF_v1_2_0(data);
     default:
       return this.generateWarningPDF_v1_2_0(data); // Update fallback
   }
   ```

5. **Mark Previous Version as FROZEN**:
   - Update v1.1.0 method comment to say [FROZEN]
   - Add ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT MODIFY warnings to v1.1.0

6. **Update Version History** (lines 40-51):
   ```typescript
   * - v1.2.0 (2025-XX-XX): Description of changes [CURRENT]
   *   - What changed and why
   ```

7. **Update CLAUDE.md**: Add v1.2.0 to version status list

8. **Test Thoroughly**:
   - Create new warning, verify it stores v1.2.0
   - Regenerate old v1.0.0 warning, verify format unchanged
   - Regenerate old v1.1.0 warning, verify format unchanged
   - Download, preview, print all versions

### **Semantic Versioning Rules**

- **MAJOR (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes to PDF structure (page layout, sections)
- **MINOR (0.X.0)**: Content changes (field additions, formatting tweaks, text changes)
- **PATCH (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes that don't affect visible output (code refactoring only)

### **Testing Checklist**

When versioning changes are made:

- [ ] New warnings store current version in Firestore
- [ ] Old warnings regenerate with their original version
- [ ] All 6 regeneration points pass stored version
- [ ] Version routing works for all versions
- [ ] No modifications to frozen version methods
- [ ] Comments updated with [FROZEN] or [CURRENT] status
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with version information
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] Production deployment successful

### **Legal Compliance Impact**

This versioning system is **CRITICAL** for:
- **Court proceedings**: Historical warnings must match original documents
- **Audits**: Consistency required for labor law compliance
- **Appeals**: Documents must be identical across time
- **CCMA cases**: Document tampering allegations avoided

**Modifying frozen versions could result in:**
- ‚ùå Documents being challenged in court
- ‚ùå Losing CCMA/labor disputes
- ‚ùå Legal liability for the organization
- ‚ùå Loss of document integrity and trust

  - **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Ready for production use

### Previous Changes (Session 22 - 2025-10-13)
- **CRITICAL: Manager Name in PDF Signatures** - Fixed missing manager name in PDF signature section
  - **Problem**: Manager signature section showed blank line `Manager Name: _____________________` instead of actual manager name
  - **Root Cause**: Enhanced Warning Wizard was NOT saving `issuedBy` and `issuedByName` fields to Firestore when creating warnings
  - **Solution**: Added manager information to warning creation in wizard
    - `EnhancedWarningWizard.tsx` (lines 779-781): Added `issuedBy: user?.uid` and `issuedByName: currentManagerName`
    - `pdfDataTransformer.ts` (line 148): Already configured to extract `issuedByName` from warning data
    - `PDFGenerationService.ts`: Already configured to display manager name in signatures
  - **Impact**:
    - ‚úÖ NEW warnings (created after fix) will display manager name correctly
    - ‚ùå EXISTING warnings (created before fix) do NOT have this field in Firestore and will continue showing blank
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/EnhancedWarningWizard.tsx` (lines 779-781)
    - `frontend/src/utils/pdfDataTransformer.ts` (line 148)
- **PDF Signature Layout Fixes** - Improved signature positioning and spacing in PDFs
  - **Problem**: Signatures were rendering on the bottom line of boxes instead of being properly centered
  - **Solution**:
    - Changed from centering vertically to positioning from top (5mm from top)
    - Reduced max signature height from 37mm to 35mm for better spacing
    - Increased padding from 8mm total to 16mm total (8mm each side)
    - Moved manager name and date below signature boxes with better spacing (+7mm and +11mm)
  - **Result**: Signatures now render properly centered with professional spacing throughout
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `frontend/src/services/PDFGenerationService.ts` (lines 970-1093)

### Previous Changes (Session 21 - 2025-10-10)
- **PDF A4 Formatting Fixes**: Comprehensive formatting improvements for professional A4 warning documents
  - **Previous Disciplinary Action Section**: Reduced font from 14pt to 12pt, increased padding and line spacing
  - **Consequences Section**: Removed emoji (‚ö†Ô∏è), split heading across 2 lines to prevent cut-off, increased box height and padding
  - **Employee Rights Section**: Removed emoji (‚öñÔ∏è), increased box height from 85mm to 102mm, optimized line spacing from 4.5 to 5mm
  - **Spacing Improvements**: Increased spacing after Employee Rights box from 12mm to 35mm to eliminate overlap with Signatures section
  - **All sections**: Reduced heading font sizes from 14pt to 12pt for proper A4 readability
  - **Result**: Clean, professional PDFs with no emoji rendering issues, no text cut-off, proper spacing throughout
- **CRITICAL: Firestore Timestamp Date Fix**: Fixed historical warnings showing incorrect dates in PDFs
  - **Problem**: Old warnings were showing today's date (10 October 2025) instead of their original issue date in signatures and document fields
  - **Root Cause**: Firestore Timestamp objects (`{ seconds, nanoseconds }`) were not being converted to JavaScript Date objects in PrintDeliveryGuide.tsx
  - **Solution**: Added `convertTimestampToDate()` helper function that properly converts Firestore Timestamps using `new Date(timestamp.seconds * 1000)`
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `frontend/src/components/hr/PrintDeliveryGuide.tsx` (lines 146-177) - Added timestamp conversion for `issuedDate` and `incidentDate`
    - `frontend/src/services/PDFGenerationService.ts` (lines 933-1010) - Updated signature dates to use `issuedDate` parameter
  - **Impact**: Historical warnings now display their correct original dates, ensuring legal compliance and accurate record-keeping
- **Unified PDF Data Transformer**: Created centralized data transformation utility for consistent PDF generation across all components
  - **Created**: `frontend/src/utils/pdfDataTransformer.ts` - Single source of truth for transforming warning data to PDF format
  - **Security-critical**: Ensures consistent data structure across all PDF generation methods (prevents data leakage or inconsistencies)
  - **Updated components**:
    - `PrintDeliveryGuide.tsx` - Uses unified transformer for on-demand PDF generation
    - `PDFPreviewModal.tsx` - Uses unified transformer for preview generation
    - `SimplePDFDownloadModal.tsx` - Uses unified transformer for simple downloads
  - **Benefits**: Eliminates duplicate transformation logic, ensures all PDFs have identical data structure, easier to maintain and debug
- **PDFPreviewModal Data Structure Fix**: Fixed console errors when viewing PDFs in Review Warnings modal
  - **Error**: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')` at PDFPreviewModal.tsx:177
  - **Root Cause**: After unified transformer migration, `extractedData.category` changed from object `{name: string}` to plain string
  - **Fixed locations**:
    - Line 177: Changed `extractedData.category.name.replace()` ‚Üí `(extractedData.category || 'Warning').replace()`
    - Lines 194-196: Changed `extractedData.incident.description` ‚Üí `extractedData.description`
    - Lines 459, 572: Changed `extractedData.category.name` ‚Üí `extractedData.category`
    - Lines 430, 626: Changed `extractedData.incident.description` ‚Üí `extractedData.description`
  - **Result**: PDF preview modal now works correctly with unified transformer data structure
- **PDF Signature Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Fixed signature distortion in generated PDFs
  - **Problem**: Signatures appeared stretched/distorted - dimensions didn't match original captured signatures
  - **Root Cause**: Both manager and employee signatures used hardcoded height (15mm) regardless of original proportions
  - **Solution**: Implemented proper aspect ratio preservation algorithm
    - Load original image dimensions from base64 signature data using `Image()` object
    - Calculate aspect ratio: `width / height`
    - Scale to fit max width, check if height exceeds max height
    - If height exceeds max, scale based on height instead
    - Center signature horizontally within box for better presentation
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `PDFGenerationService.ts` (lines 966-997): Manager signature aspect ratio preservation
    - `PDFGenerationService.ts` (lines 1011-1042): Employee signature aspect ratio preservation
  - **Result**: Signatures now maintain original proportions and are professionally centered in PDFs

### Session 20 Changes (2025-10-08)
- **Modal Accessibility Completion**: Fixed 2 remaining modals missing accessibility features from Week 2-3 implementation
  - **DeliveryMethodSelectionModal**: Added focus trap, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, `min-h-0` for proper scrolling
  - **EmployeeFormModal**: Replaced manual body scroll with `usePreventBodyScroll()` hook, added focus trap, ARIA labels, standardized z-index
  - All 21+ modals now have: proper viewport centering, body scroll prevention, standardized z-index, and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
- **Modal System Verification**: Completed full audit of all modals to ensure consistent implementation
  - Verified UnifiedModal-based modals (BulkAssignDepartmentModal, BulkAssignManagerModal)
  - Verified standard pattern modals (all warning modals, employee modals)
  - Confirmed all modals follow Week 1 + Week 2-3 patterns

### Session 19 Changes (2025-10-08)

  - Added employee data structure transformation (nested `profile`/`employment` ‚Üí flat structure)
  - Fixed field mapping (`level` ‚Üí `warningLevel`, `issueDate` ‚Üí `issuedDate`, etc.)
  - Removed "print on letterhead" instruction (PDF generates its own letterhead)
- **Workflow Simplification**: Streamlined Print & Hand Delivery process for better UX
  - **Step 2**: Reduced to 1 checkbox (removed witness name, additional notes, redundant checks)
