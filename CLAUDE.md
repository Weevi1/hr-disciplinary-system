## Architecture Summary

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions + Firestore + Storage
- **Firebase Regions**:
  - **Primary**: `us-central1` (most functions, main server)
  - **Secondary**: `us-east1` (super user functions only - new server)
- **Key Features**: Multi-sector HR management, role-based access, real-time notifications, QR code document delivery

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Code Changes**: Use existing patterns and design system
2. **Testing**: Manual testing preferred for development efficiency
   - E2E Playwright framework available: `npm run test:e2e` (use only when specifically requested)
   - Firebase emulator testing: `npm run test:firebase`
3. **Builds**: Allow 5+ minutes for full production builds
4. **Never commit**: Unless explicitly requested by user
5. **🚫 FIRESTORE INDEXES**: Never programmatically deploy indexes via firebase.json - user creates them manually in Firebase Console using error links

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Firebase Functions Deployment Regions

### **Server Configuration**
- **PRIMARY SERVER: `us-central1`** - Main deployment region (most functions)
- **SECONDARY SERVER: `us-east1`** - New server (super user functions only)

### **Frontend Configuration**
- **Current**: `frontend/src/config/firebase.ts` uses `us-central1`
- **⚠️ WARNING**: Only change region if deploying to different server
- **Rule**: Always match frontend region with target function's deployment region

### **Current Function Distribution**
```bash
us-central1: Most functions (reseller, organization, auth, billing, audio, etc.)
us-east1:    getSuperUserInfo, manageSuperUser (super user functions only)
```

### **✅ ALWAYS DO**
- Use existing patterns and design system
- Check for similar code in components before adding new code
- Run lint and typecheck commands after significant changes if available
- Use absolute file paths in tools

  - ✅ **Root Cause 1**: `.modal-content__scrollable` had **zero bottom padding** across all screen sizes
  - ✅ **Root Cause 2**: `.modal-header__center` (progress section) had **no CSS** - used default flex causing layout issues
  - ✅ **Root Cause 3**: `.modal-system` had `padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top)` pushing footer below viewport
  - ✅ **Root Cause 4**: `.modal-open` only set `overflow: hidden` but didn't constrain body height - MainLayout's `min-h-screen` made body taller than viewport
  - ✅ **Impact**: Users couldn't scroll to see footer buttons - modal footer pushed below visible area
  - ✅ **Fix 1**: Added **1rem (16px) bottom padding** to scrollable content area (6 instances)
  - ✅ **Fix 2**: Added `flex-shrink: 0` to progress section to prevent it from expanding
  - ✅ **Fix 3**: Removed safe-area padding from modal-system (already constrained by fixed positioning)
  - ✅ **Fix 4**: Added `height: 100vh/100dvh` to `.modal-open` class to constrain body to viewport height
  - ✅ **Fix 5**: Added `min-height: 0` to `.modal-content` to allow flex shrinking
  - ✅ **Files Changed**:
    - `frontend/src/modal-system.css` - lines 150-158, 199-204, 651, 659, 1895, 1911, 1980, 2107, 2137
    - `frontend/src/styles/accessibility.css` - lines 195-199
  - ✅ **Result**: Modal constrained to viewport - footer always visible at bottom, content scrolls correctly
  - ✅ **Coverage**: Fixed for all screen sizes (tiny phones to modern large screens)

- **Audio Recording Loop Fix - Max Size Handling 🎙️**
  - ✅ **Root Cause**: `ondataavailable` fires every second, continuing to add chunks even while async `stopRecording()` executes
  - ✅ **Issue**: Size kept growing (801KB → 803KB → 805KB → 903KB...) creating infinite loop
  - ✅ **Fix Applied**:
    - Check `isStoppingRef` flag at START of `ondataavailable` to skip queued chunks
    - Call `mediaRecorder.stop()` **directly** when max size reached (not async function)
    - Immediately stops MediaRecorder from queuing new events
  - ✅ **Files Changed**: `frontend/src/hooks/warnings/useAudioRecording.ts` - line 452-480
  - ✅ **Result**: Recording stops immediately at max size with all audio preserved
  - ✅ **Behavior**: Hits 800KB → sets flag → stops recorder → skips remaining chunks → processes final blob

### **🔧 Recent Fixes (Session 11 Continued) - DROPDOWN POSITIONING & Z-INDEX**

- **Dropdown/Selector Positioning Fix - Mobile Floating Modals 📱**
  - ✅ **Issue**: With modal now scrollable (`position: absolute`), dropdowns appeared from footer upward
  - ✅ **Mobile Solution**: Changed dropdowns to `position: fixed` with `z-index: 10001` (above parent modal)
  - ✅ **Desktop Behavior**: Kept `position: absolute top-full` for proper dropdown positioning
  - ✅ **Components Fixed**:
    - `EmployeeSelector.tsx` - Warning wizard employee selection
    - `CategorySelector.tsx` - Warning wizard category selection
    - `UniversalEmployeeSelector.tsx` - Used in HR Meeting, Absence Reports, Counselling
  - ✅ **Mobile Modal Z-Index**: Increased from `9998` → `10000` for employee/category modals
  - ✅ **Result**: Dropdowns now appear as floating overlays on mobile, proper dropdowns on desktop
  - ✅ **Coverage**: All modals (Warning, HR Meeting, Report Absence, Counselling)

### **🔧 Recent Fixes (Session 11 Continued) - MOBILE MODAL CENTERING**

- **Mobile Selection Modal Centering Fix 🎯**
  - ✅ **Issue**: Employee/Category selection modals appeared at bottom of screen instead of centered
  - ✅ **Root Causes Discovered**:
    1. Using `position: absolute` positioned relative to scrollable parent (not viewport)
    2. Using percentage units (`top: 50%`) calculated from parent height
    3. Backdrop also positioned as `absolute` instead of `fixed`
  - ✅ **Iterations**:
    - Attempt 1: Changed `margin: auto 0 0 0` → `margin: auto` (didn't work)
    - Attempt 2: Added flexbox `align-items: center; justify-content: center` (still bottom)
    - Attempt 3: `position: absolute; top: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` (still wrong)
    - Attempt 4: Changed to `position: fixed` (got closer)
    - Final Fix: Used viewport units `top: 50vh` then adjusted to `45vh` for header offset
  - ✅ **Final Solution**:
    ```css
    .mobile-employee-modal-backdrop {
      position: fixed !important; /* Not absolute */
    }
    .mobile-employee-modal-content {
      position: fixed !important; /* Not absolute */
      top: 45vh !important; /* Use vh, not %, offset for header */
      left: 50vw !important;
      transform: translate(-50%, -50%) !important;
    }
    ```
  - ✅ **Files Changed**: `frontend/src/modal-system.css` - lines 932-965, 1079-1113
  - ✅ **Result**: Modals perfectly centered in viewport, accounting for MainLayout header
  - ✅ **Applied To**: Both `.mobile-employee-modal` and `.mobile-category-modal`

### **🔧 Recent Fixes (Session 11 Continued) - STEP 2 UX IMPROVEMENTS**

- **Warning Wizard Step 2 - User-Friendly Redesign ✨**
  - ✅ **Issue**: Step 2 was "very factual, but not very user friendly" - managers unclear on what to do next
  - ✅ **Improvements Applied**:
    1. **Action-Oriented Header**: Added "📋 Review & Prepare for Warning Meeting" with time estimate (5-10 minutes)
    2. **Numbered Workflow Guide**: Clear 4-step process with emoji indicators:
       - 1️⃣ Review the system recommendation below (legal analysis)
       - 2️⃣ Read the employee warning script thoroughly
       - 3️⃣ Conduct a private meeting with the employee
       - 4️⃣ Collect both signatures (yours and employee's)
    3. **Warning Severity Badge**: Shows warning level and offense type at a glance
    4. **Friendlier LRA Text**: Changed "Legal analysis complete" → "🎯 System Recommendation"
    5. **Context-Aware Explanation**:
       - First offense: "Since this is a first offense, we recommend starting with [level] rather than a formal written warning. This follows best practice progressive discipline."
       - Escalation: "This employee has X previous warning(s). We're escalating to [level] to follow proper progressive discipline procedures."
    6. **Script Section Enhancement**: Added clear instructions - "Read this script before your meeting. It ensures you cover all legal requirements..."
    7. **"What Happens After Signatures?" Callout**: Info box explaining:
       - ✅ Warning officially recorded
       - 📧 Employee receives copy
       - 🔔 HR notified automatically
       - ⏱️ 60-day countdown begins
    8. **Visual Hierarchy**: Added emoji icons throughout (📋, 🎯, 📖, ℹ️, ✍️)
  - ✅ **Files Changed**: `frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/steps/LegalReviewSignaturesStepV2.tsx`
  - ✅ **Result**: Managers now have clear guidance on workflow and understand what happens at each stage
  - ✅ **User Feedback**: "Tell me before you implement" → User approved all improvements

### **🔧 Recent Fixes (Session 11 Continued) - SIGNATURE VALIDATION**

- **Digital Signature Pad - Validation Fix ✍️**
  - ✅ **Issue**: Signatures showing "Signature too simple" error even though marked as "✓ Signed"
  - ✅ **Root Cause**: Overly strict validation requiring 2+ strokes (line 253)
  - ✅ **Problem**: Most real signatures are single continuous strokes, not multiple strokes
  - ✅ **Old Validation**: `strokes.length >= 2 && strokes.some(stroke => stroke.points.length >= 3)`
  - ✅ **New Validation**:
    - Single stroke with 5+ points (realistic signature motion), OR
    - 2+ strokes (initials/complex signatures)
  - ✅ **UX Improvements**:
    - Removed "Signature too simple" error message entirely
    - Removed amber border for "invalid" signatures
    - All signatures now get green border when captured
    - Removed debug "Strokes: X | Valid: Y" text
  - ✅ **Image Loading Fix**: Added proper scaling and error handling for initial signature display
  - ✅ **Files Changed**: `frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/steps/DigitalSignaturePad.tsx`
  - ✅ **Result**: Any signature drawn is now considered valid - no confusing error messages

### **🔧 Recent Fixes (Session 11 Continued) - STEP 3 UX IMPROVEMENTS**

- **Warning Wizard Step 3 - Delivery Setup Redesign ✨**
  - ✅ **Issue**: Step 3 was functional but not user-friendly - managers unclear on HR's role and next steps
  - ✅ **User Feedback**: "Too much focus on what HR will do... this is not the manager's business"
  - ✅ **Improvements Applied**:
    1. **Clear Header**: "📬 Delivery Setup" with explanation that this is the final step
    2. **Simplified Workflow Guide**: 3-step process (removed HR internal details):
       - 1️⃣ Choose delivery method (email, WhatsApp, or print)
       - 2️⃣ Review the document (optional preview)
       - 3️⃣ Notify your HR team - your job is done!
    3. **Manager-Focused Callout**: "Your HR Team Takes Over From Here"
       - 📧 HR will deliver the warning to [employee name] using your chosen method
       - ✅ Your responsibility ends once you click "Notify HR"
       - 📊 You can track delivery status in the warnings dashboard
    4. **Step Labels**: "📋 Step 1: Choose Delivery Method" and "📄 Step 2: Review & Send to HR"
    5. **Personalized Text**: Shows employee name in delivery method selection
    6. **Visual Hierarchy**: Emoji icons (📬, 📋, 📄, ℹ️, 📧, ✅, 📊) throughout
    7. **Cleaner Layout**: Removed redundant warning summary card, added compact badge instead
  - ✅ **Removed**: HR internal process details (collect proof, upload proof, notify manager)
  - ✅ **Files Changed**: `frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/steps/DeliveryCompletionStep.tsx`
  - ✅ **Result**: Managers understand their job is done after clicking "Notify HR" - no technical HR details
  - ✅ **Consistency**: Matches Step 2 redesign pattern (workflow guide + callouts + visual hierarchy)

- **Auto-Scroll to Top on Step Navigation 📜**
  - ✅ **Issue**: When navigating to Steps 2 and 3, page didn't scroll to top - user had to manually scroll
  - ✅ **Root Cause**: Old scroll logic only scrolled `.modal-content__scrollable`, but with new scrollable modal layout, need to scroll window
  - ✅ **Fix Applied**: Updated scroll logic to:
    1. Scroll window to top (for scrollable modal layout)
    2. Also scroll modal content if it has internal scroll
    3. Scroll modal-system container into view
    4. Fallback to instant scroll after 500ms if smooth scroll didn't work
  - ✅ **Files Changed**: `frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/EnhancedWarningWizard.tsx` - lines 275-304
  - ✅ **Result**: All step transitions (1→2, 2→3) now auto-scroll to top smoothly
  - ✅ **Coverage**: Works for all steps, not just 2 and 3

### **🔧 Recent Fixes (Session 11 Continued) - PDF PREVIEW MODAL REDESIGN**

- **PDFPreviewModal - Complete Mobile-First Rewrite 📱**
  - ✅ **Issue**: Desktop-centric design with broken mobile UX, duplicate buttons, information overload
  - ✅ **Critical Problems Fixed**:
    1. **Broken iframe on mobile** - PDF preview doesn't work in mobile browsers
    2. **Action button chaos** - Download, QR Code, Open appeared in TWO places
    3. **Information overload** - Excessive employee/incident cards forcing endless scrolling
    4. **Wrong modal pattern** - Desktop centered modal doesn't work on mobile
    5. **Tiny touch targets** - Buttons too small for mobile (< 48px)
    6. **Metadata nobody needs** - Verbose footer text and technical details

  - ✅ **Mobile Layout (Bottom Sheet)**:
    - Slides up from bottom (native mobile pattern)
    - Max height 85vh with scroll
    - **Minimal metadata**: Just name, warning type, filename, file size
    - **Large touch targets**: Primary button 56px, secondary 48px
    - **Clear hierarchy**: Download (blue, large) → QR Code + Preview (secondary)
    - **No iframe**: Preview button opens new tab instead
    - **Single action location**: All buttons in one section

  - ✅ **Desktop Layout (Sidebar + Preview)**:
    - Left sidebar (320px): Metadata + actions
    - Right side: Full-height PDF iframe preview
    - **No footer duplication**: Actions only in sidebar
    - **Better space usage**: Preview fills entire right panel
    - **Single action column**: Not scattered across modal

  - ✅ **Universal Improvements**:
    - ✅ Responsive detection (window.innerWidth < 768)
    - ✅ Removed ALL duplicate buttons
    - ✅ Removed verbose employee/incident detail cards
    - ✅ Removed footer metadata ("Generated by HR System", "LRA Compliant")
    - ✅ Primary action clarity (Download is blue/prominent)
    - ✅ Simplified loading states
    - ✅ Cleaner error handling
    - ✅ Auto-scroll to top on open

  - ✅ **Validation Improvements**:
    - ✅ Prevents auto-generation when data is incomplete
    - ✅ Shows clear "Incomplete Warning Data" message with missing items listed
    - ✅ "Return to Wizard" button to complete missing fields
    - ✅ No more "Unknown Employee" or "Category Not Selected" PDFs

  - ✅ **Files Changed**: `frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/PDFPreviewModal.tsx`
  - ✅ **Result**: Mobile users get centered modal with large touch targets, desktop users get sidebar + preview layout
  - ✅ **Impact**: Prevents generating PDFs with placeholder data, clearer user guidance

### **🔧 Recent Fixes (Session 12) - WIZARD FINALIZATION & EMPLOYEE DATA**

- **60-Day Countdown Removal - Reduced Confusion ⏱️**
  - ✅ **Issue**: Step 2 showed "⏱️ 60-day countdown begins for this warning" - confusing for managers (only applies to Manual Warning Entry)
  - ✅ **Fix**: Removed misleading countdown text from LegalReviewSignaturesStepV2.tsx
  - ✅ **Now Shows**: Only relevant info - warning recorded, employee notified, HR alerted
  - ✅ **Files Changed**: `frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/steps/LegalReviewSignaturesStepV2.tsx`

- **Employee Name Display - Fixed Data Structure 👤**
  - ✅ **Issue**: Employee names showing "undefined undefined" - accessing `selectedEmployee.firstName` directly
  - ✅ **Root Cause**: Employee interface uses nested `profile` object (profile.firstName, profile.lastName)
  - ✅ **Fixes Applied**:
    - **DeliveryCompletionStep.tsx**: UI display and delivery notification creation
    - **PDFPreviewModal.tsx**: PDF generation data extraction
  - ✅ **Pattern**: `selectedEmployee.profile?.firstName || selectedEmployee.firstName || 'Unknown'`
  - ✅ **Fallbacks**: Supports both nested and legacy flat structures
  - ✅ **Result**: Correct employee names in Step 3, PDF modal, console logs, and delivery notifications

- **QR Code Generation - Duplicate Prevention 🔄**
  - ✅ **Issue**: React StrictMode causing duplicate QR generation (two QR codes for one modal open)
  - ✅ **Fix**: Added `useRef` pattern to prevent duplicate effects in QRCodeDownloadModal.tsx
  - ✅ **Pattern**: `hasGeneratedRef.current` flag checked before generation, reset on modal close
  - ✅ **Result**: Single QR code generation per modal open, reduced Firebase resource usage

- **Modal Button Cleanup - Reduced Redundancy 🎯**
  - ✅ **PDFPreviewModal**:
    - Removed "Download PDF" button from both mobile and desktop views
    - Users can download from Preview tab instead
    - Kept only QR Code and Preview buttons
  - ✅ **QRCodeDownloadModal**:
    - Removed "Test Link" button (unnecessary - link works or it doesn't)
    - Removed "Revoke" button and handler functions
    - Removed unused imports (Eye, Trash2)
    - Updated security notice: removed "Can be revoked instantly" text
    - Now shows only "Copy Download Link" as primary action
  - ✅ **Files Changed**:
    - `frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/PDFPreviewModal.tsx`
    - `frontend/src/components/warnings/modals/QRCodeDownloadModal.tsx`
  - ✅ **Result**: Cleaner UX, less button chaos, clearer primary actions

- **Finalize Button - Footer Integration ✅**
  - ✅ **Issue**: "Notify HR Team" button in Step 3 content - inconsistent with wizard navigation pattern
  - ✅ **User Request**: Move to footer next to "Previous", rename to "Finalize"
  - ✅ **Implementation**:
    - Added `onFinalizeReady` prop to DeliveryCompletionStep
    - Passes `{ canFinalize: boolean, finalizeHandler: () => void }` to parent
    - Modified wizard `getNextButtonState()` to show "Finalize" button on last step
    - Updated `nextStep()` handler to call finalization when on final step
    - Removed "Notify HR Team" button from step content
    - Auto-closes wizard 2 seconds after successful HR notification
  - ✅ **Files Changed**:
    - `frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/steps/DeliveryCompletionStep.tsx`
    - `frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/EnhancedWarningWizard.tsx`
  - ✅ **Result**: Consistent footer navigation, "Finalize" button appears next to "Previous" on Step 3
  - ✅ **UX Flow**: Select delivery → Click Finalize → HR notified → Wizard auto-closes → Return to dashboard

- **Employee Email Fallback - Firestore Compatibility 📧**
  - ✅ **Issue**: `employeeEmail: undefined` causing Firestore errors (Unsupported field value)
  - ✅ **Fix**: Changed fallback from `undefined` to empty string `''`
  - ✅ **Pattern**: `selectedEmployee.profile?.email || selectedEmployee.email || ''`
  - ✅ **Impact**: Delivery notifications save successfully even without employee email
  - ✅ **Files Changed**: `frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/steps/DeliveryCompletionStep.tsx`

### **🔧 Recent Fixes (Session 13) - MULTI-LANGUAGE WARNING SCRIPT & LOGGING CONSISTENCY**

- **Warning Script Translations - All 11 SA Languages 🌍**
  - ✅ **Issue**: Warning script said generic text instead of specific warning level (Counselling, Verbal, First Written, etc.)
  - ✅ **Translation System**: Added complete warning level translations for all 11 South African official languages
  - ✅ **Languages Supported**:
    - English: Counselling Session, Verbal Warning, First Written Warning, Second Written Warning, Final Written Warning
    - Afrikaans: Beradingsessie, Mondelinge Waarskuwing, Eerste Geskrewe Waarskuwing, etc.
    - Zulu: Iseshini Yokweluleka, Isexwayiso Ngomlomo, Isexwayiso Sokuqala Esibhaliwe, etc.
    - Xhosa, Sotho, Tsonga, Venda, Swati, Tswana, Ndebele, Northern Sotho (all complete)
  - ✅ **Dynamic Level Detection**: Script uses override level (if manually selected) or LRA recommendation
  - ✅ **Helper Function**: `getWarningLevelTranslation()` converts system levels to translated text
  - ✅ **Files Changed**: `frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/steps/components/MultiLanguageWarningScript.tsx`
  - ✅ **Result**: Section 4 of warning script now says "I am issuing you with a First Written Warning" in employee's chosen language

- **Bug Fix - Missing X Icon 🐛**
  - ✅ **Issue**: Clicking close button (X) on override selector crashed with "X is not defined"
  - ✅ **Fix**: Added missing `X` icon import from lucide-react
  - ✅ **Files Changed**: `frontend/src/components/warnings/enhanced/steps/LegalReviewSignaturesStepV2.tsx`
  - ✅ **Result**: Override selector close button now works correctly

- **Logging Consistency - SHARD Terminology 📋**
  - ✅ **Issue**: Console logs showed "[FLAT]" but architecture docs call it "sharded"
  - ✅ **Confusion**: "Flat" vs "Sharded" vs "Nested" - same structure, different names
  - ✅ **Fix**: Changed all "[FLAT]" labels to "[SHARD]" across codebase
  - ✅ **Locations Updated**:
    - Warning creation logs: `📋 [SHARD] Warning created`
    - Warning update logs: `📋 [SHARD] Warning updated successfully`
    - Dual-write logs: "saved to sharded structure"
    - ReviewDashboard logs: `(SHARDED structure)`
  - ✅ **Files Changed**:
    - `frontend/src/api/index.ts` - 5 log messages updated
    - `frontend/src/components/warnings/ReviewDashboard.tsx` - 1 log message updated
  - ✅ **Result**: Console logs now align with `DATABASE_SHARDING_ARCHITECTURE.md` terminology
  - ✅ **Architecture**: `organizations/{orgId}/warnings/{id}` = sharded (one subcollection per org)
