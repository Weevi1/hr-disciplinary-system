## Architecture Summary
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions + Firestore + Storage
- **Firebase Regions**:
  - **Primary**: `us-central1` (most functions, main server)
  - **Secondary**: `us-east1` (super user functions only - new server)
- **Key Features**: Multi-sector HR management, role-based access, real-time notifications, QR code document delivery

## Development Workflow
1. **Code Changes**: Use existing patterns and design system
2. **Testing**: Manual testing preferred for development efficiency
   - E2E Playwright framework available: `npm run test:e2e` (use only when specifically requested)
   - Firebase emulator testing: `npm run test:firebase`
3. **Builds**: Allow 5+ minutes for full production builds
4. **Never commit**: Unless explicitly requested by user
5. **üö´ FIRESTORE INDEXES**: Never programmatically deploy indexes via firebase.json - user creates them manually in Firebase Console using error links

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Firebase Functions Deployment Regions

### **Server Configuration**
- **PRIMARY SERVER: `us-central1`** - Main deployment region (most functions)
- **SECONDARY SERVER: `us-east1`** - New server (super user functions only)

### **Frontend Configuration**
- **Current**: `frontend/src/config/firebase.ts` uses `us-central1`
- **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Only change region if deploying to different server
- **Rule**: Always match frontend region with target function's deployment region

### **Current Function Distribution**
```bash
us-central1: Most functions (reseller, organization, auth, billing, audio, etc.)
us-east1:    getSuperUserInfo, manageSuperUser (super user functions only)
```

- **Unified Design**: Follows Enhanced Warning Wizard Step 1 design patterns

#### **üîí DATA STRUCTURE**
```typescript
interface Department {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  managerId?: string; // Employee ID of department manager
  managerName?: string; // Cached for display
  managerEmail?: string; // Cached for display
  employeeCount: number; // Auto-maintained
  isDefault: boolean; // Operations and Admin
  organizationId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

#### **üìã FILES CREATED/MODIFIED**
**New Files**:
- `frontend/src/components/admin/DepartmentManagement.tsx` - Complete CRUD component
- `frontend/src/services/DepartmentService.ts` - Service layer with Firestore integration
- `frontend/src/types/department.ts` - Type definitions and default department templates

**Modified Files**:
- `frontend/src/services/EmployeeService.ts` - Fixed department field access and added count integration
- `frontend/src/components/admin/EnhancedOrganizationWizard.tsx` - Added default department creation
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/BusinessOwnerDashboardSection.tsx` - Integrated department management

#### **üõ†Ô∏è CRITICAL FIX: Hardcoded Department Data (2025-09-29)**
**Problem**: OrganizationManagementV2 was showing 3 hardcoded departments (Operations, Production, Quality Assurance) instead of real Firebase data (2 departments: Operations, Admin)

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Fixed File**: `frontend/src/components/organization/OrganizationManagementV2.tsx`
- **Added Import**: `DepartmentService` for real department data loading
- **Replaced**: Hardcoded `mockDepartments` array with `DepartmentService.getDepartments()` call
- **Updated**: Stats calculation to use real department count
- **Result**: Dashboard now shows actual Firebase department data (2 departments) instead of hardcoded 3

**Technical Changes**:
- Lines 339-351: Load real departments using `DepartmentService.getDepartments(organization.id)`
- Lines 354-365: Use `realDepartments.length` for accurate department count in stats
- Proper department manager assignment from actual user data

#### **üöÄ ENHANCED USER CREATION SYSTEM (2025-09-29)**
**Feature**: Business owners can now promote existing employees to HR/Department manager roles OR create new managers

**Key Features**:
1. **Dual Selection Mode**:
   - **Promote Existing Employee**: Select from current employee roster and create user account
   - **Create New Manager**: Create both user account AND employee record simultaneously

2. **Smart Defaults**:
   - Automatically selects "Promote" mode when employees exist
   - Falls back to "Create" mode when no employees available
   - Handles early-stage vs established organization scenarios

3. **Employee Integration**:
   - New managers created via "Create" mode automatically get employee records
   - Promoted employees get linked user accounts with management roles
   - Minimal employee data initially (name, email) - HR can enhance later

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Enhanced Modal**: `OrganizationManagementV2.tsx` AddUserModal component
- **Selection Interface**: Radio buttons for promote vs create modes
- **Employee Selector**: Dropdown showing current employees with department info
- **Dynamic Validation**: Different validation rules for each mode
- **Cloud Function Integration**: Enhanced `createOrganizationUser` with `employeeId` and `createEmployee` flags

**User Experience**:
- **Dynamic Button Text**: "Promote Employee" vs "Create Manager"
- **Contextual Descriptions**: Modal subtitle changes based on selected mode
- **Employee Preview**: Shows selected employee details when promoting
- **Automatic Email Generation**: Creates emails for promoted employees if missing

## üîß USER MANAGEMENT & EMPLOYEE FIXES (2025-09-29 - Session 2)

### **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Fixed User Management Interface Issues**

#### **üéØ Problem 1: "No manageable users found" despite users existing**
**Root Cause**: The `useUserManagement` hook was loading users from the old flat `users` collection instead of the sharded database structure.

**Solution Applied**:
- **File**: `frontend/src/hooks/useUserManagement.ts`
- **Import Added**: `DatabaseShardingService` for sharded database access
- **loadUsers() Function**: Updated to use `DatabaseShardingService.queryDocuments(organizationId, 'users', [])` instead of `FirebaseService.getCollection(COLLECTIONS.USERS)`
- **User Filtering**: Added proper filtering to exclude business owners and show only manageable users with role validation
- **Sharded Operations**: Updated `deactivateUser()`, `reactivateUser()`, and `updateUser()` functions to use `DatabaseShardingService.updateDocument()`

**Technical Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD (Broken)
const allUsers = await FirebaseService.getCollection<any>(COLLECTIONS.USERS);

// NEW (Fixed)
const usersResult = await DatabaseShardingService.queryDocuments(
  currentUser.organizationId,
  'users',
  []
);
```

#### **üéØ Problem 2: Missing close/back button in User Management**
**Root Cause**: User Management is accessed via route `/users` but had no navigation back to dashboard.

**Solution Applied**:
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/users/UserManagement.tsx`
- **Import Added**: `ArrowLeft` icon and `useNavigate` hook from react-router-dom
- **Back Button**: Added professional back button in header section with proper styling
- **Navigation**: Button navigates to `/dashboard` with tooltip "Back to Dashboard"
- **Design Consistency**: Button follows existing `hr-button-outline` style patterns

### **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Fixed Employee Management TypeError**

#### **üéØ Problem: JavaScript Runtime Error**
**Error**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'activeWarnings')`
**Location**: `employee.ts:508` in `calculateEmployeeStats` function
**Component**: EmployeeStats component causing Employee Management to crash

**Root Cause**: The function was accessing nested properties without null checks:
- `employee.disciplinaryRecord.activeWarnings` - when `disciplinaryRecord` was undefined
- `employee.profile.department` - when `profile` was undefined
- `employee.employment.contractType` - when `employment` was undefined
- `employee.employment.probationEndDate` - when `employment` was undefined

**Solution Applied**:
- **File**: `frontend/src/types/employee.ts`
- **Line 508**: Added optional chaining `employee.disciplinaryRecord?.activeWarnings > 0`
- **Line 503**: Added optional chaining `employee.employment?.probationEndDate`
- **Line 513**: Added fallback `employee.profile?.department || 'Unknown'`
- **Line 516**: Added fallback `employee.employment?.contractType || 'Unknown'`

### **üéØ Enhanced User Creation System Status**

#### **üîß Cloud Function Enhancements Complete**
**File**: `functions/src/createOrganizationUser.ts`
- **Dual-Mode User Creation**: Business owners can either promote existing employees OR create new managers with automatic employee records
- **Email Verification**: Business owners can verify/update employee email addresses during promotion
- **Employee Record Creation**: New managers automatically get both user accounts AND employee records
- **Integration Flags**: `createEmployee`, `employeeId`, `updateEmployeeEmail` parameters implemented

#### **üîß Frontend Integration Status**
**File**: `frontend/src/components/organization/OrganizationManagementV2.tsx`
- **Dual Selection Modes**: Employee promotion vs new manager creation interfaces implemented
- **Email Verification UI**: Visual indicators and input fields for email verification during promotion
- **Enhanced AddUserModal**: Complete dual-mode selection with employee dropdown and validation
