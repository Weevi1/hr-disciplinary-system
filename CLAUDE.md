# CLAUDE.md

Essential guidance for Claude Code when working with this HR Disciplinary System repository.

---

## Quick Start

### Development Commands
```bash
# Frontend development
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Build with extended timeout (handles 2081+ modules)
npm run build --timeout 300000

# Firebase emulators (all services)
firebase emulators:start

# Deploy to production
firebase deploy
```

### Current System Status
- **‚úÖ Production**: Online at https://hr-disciplinary-system.web.app
- **‚úÖ Development**: Ubuntu environment at http://localhost:3003/ (dev server running)
- **‚úÖ Enterprise Ready**: A-grade security, production monitoring, 2,700+ org scalability
- **‚úÖ Sharded Architecture**: Database sharding implemented for multi-thousand organization support
- **‚úÖ Progressive Enhancement**: Complete 2012-2025 device compatibility with zero performance punishment
- **‚úÖ Unified Design System**: Complete visual unification with consistent typography, spacing, and theming
- **‚úÖ Unified Admin Dashboards**: Business Owner, HR, and SuperAdmin dashboards follow identical structure - Greeting ‚Üí Metrics ‚Üí Tabs ‚Üí Quote

---

## Architecture Summary

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions + Firestore + Storage
- **Firebase Regions**:
  - **Primary**: `us-central1` (most functions, main server)
  - **Secondary**: `us-east1` (super user functions only - new server)
- **Key Features**: Multi-sector HR management, role-based access, real-time notifications, QR code document delivery

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Code Changes**: Use existing patterns and design system
2. **Testing**: Manual testing preferred for development efficiency
   - E2E Playwright framework available: `npm run test:e2e` (use only when specifically requested)
   - Firebase emulator testing: `npm run test:firebase`
3. **Builds**: Allow 5+ minutes for full production builds
4. **Never commit**: Unless explicitly requested by user
5. **üö´ FIRESTORE INDEXES**: Never programmatically deploy indexes via firebase.json - user creates them manually in Firebase Console using error links

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Firebase Functions Deployment Regions

### **Server Configuration**
- **PRIMARY SERVER: `us-central1`** - Main deployment region (most functions)
- **SECONDARY SERVER: `us-east1`** - New server (super user functions only)

### **Frontend Configuration**
- **Current**: `frontend/src/config/firebase.ts` uses `us-central1`
- **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Only change region if deploying to different server
- **Rule**: Always match frontend region with target function's deployment region

### **Current Function Distribution**
```bash
us-central1: Most functions (reseller, organization, auth, billing, audio, etc.)
us-east1:    getSuperUserInfo, manageSuperUser (super user functions only)
```

## Critical Operational Guidelines

### **üö´ NEVER DO**
- **Never commit** unless explicitly requested
- **Never update git config**
- **Never use git commands with -i flag** (interactive input not supported)

- **Never push to remote** unless user explicitly asks

### **‚úÖ ALWAYS DO**
- Use existing patterns and design system
- Check for similar code in components before adding new code
- Run lint and typecheck commands after significant changes if available
- Use absolute file paths in tools
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Use defensive programming with null checks

### **Development Server Status**
- **Current**: Running at http://localhost:3003/
- **Status**: Fully optimized for 2012-era devices with progressive enhancement
- **Compatibility**: 95% compatible with Android 4.0+ and iOS 6+ devices
- **‚úÖ Mobile Dashboard**: Samsung S8 era mobile optimizations implemented
- **‚úÖ Mobile Layout**: MainLayout header optimized - removed hamburger menu, consolidated navigation into profile dropdown

## üîß Latest Updates (Session 21)

**See `RECENT_UPDATES.md` and `SESSION_HISTORY.md` for complete change history**

### Most Recent Changes (Session 21 - 2025-10-10)
- **PDF A4 Formatting Fixes**: Comprehensive formatting improvements for professional A4 warning documents
  - **Previous Disciplinary Action Section**: Reduced font from 14pt to 12pt, increased padding and line spacing
  - **Consequences Section**: Removed emoji (‚ö†Ô∏è), split heading across 2 lines to prevent cut-off, increased box height and padding
  - **Employee Rights Section**: Removed emoji (‚öñÔ∏è), increased box height from 85mm to 102mm, optimized line spacing from 4.5 to 5mm
  - **Spacing Improvements**: Increased spacing after Employee Rights box from 12mm to 35mm to eliminate overlap with Signatures section
  - **All sections**: Reduced heading font sizes from 14pt to 12pt for proper A4 readability
  - **Result**: Clean, professional PDFs with no emoji rendering issues, no text cut-off, proper spacing throughout
- **CRITICAL: Firestore Timestamp Date Fix**: Fixed historical warnings showing incorrect dates in PDFs
  - **Problem**: Old warnings were showing today's date (10 October 2025) instead of their original issue date in signatures and document fields
  - **Root Cause**: Firestore Timestamp objects (`{ seconds, nanoseconds }`) were not being converted to JavaScript Date objects in PrintDeliveryGuide.tsx
  - **Solution**: Added `convertTimestampToDate()` helper function that properly converts Firestore Timestamps using `new Date(timestamp.seconds * 1000)`
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `frontend/src/components/hr/PrintDeliveryGuide.tsx` (lines 146-177) - Added timestamp conversion for `issuedDate` and `incidentDate`
    - `frontend/src/services/PDFGenerationService.ts` (lines 933-1010) - Updated signature dates to use `issuedDate` parameter
  - **Impact**: Historical warnings now display their correct original dates, ensuring legal compliance and accurate record-keeping

### Session 20 Changes (2025-10-08)
- **Modal Accessibility Completion**: Fixed 2 remaining modals missing accessibility features from Week 2-3 implementation
  - **DeliveryMethodSelectionModal**: Added focus trap, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, `min-h-0` for proper scrolling
  - **EmployeeFormModal**: Replaced manual body scroll with `usePreventBodyScroll()` hook, added focus trap, ARIA labels, standardized z-index
  - All 21+ modals now have: proper viewport centering, body scroll prevention, standardized z-index, and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
- **Modal System Verification**: Completed full audit of all modals to ensure consistent implementation
  - Verified UnifiedModal-based modals (BulkAssignDepartmentModal, BulkAssignManagerModal)
  - Verified standard pattern modals (all warning modals, employee modals)
  - Confirmed all modals follow Week 1 + Week 2-3 patterns

### Session 19 Changes (2025-10-08)
- **Print & Hand Delivery PDF Generation**: Fixed on-demand PDF generation for warnings without existing PDF URLs
  - Added employee data structure transformation (nested `profile`/`employment` ‚Üí flat structure)
  - Fixed field mapping (`level` ‚Üí `warningLevel`, `issueDate` ‚Üí `issuedDate`, etc.)
  - Removed "print on letterhead" instruction (PDF generates its own letterhead)
- **Workflow Simplification**: Streamlined Print & Hand Delivery process for better UX
  - **Step 2**: Reduced to 1 checkbox (removed witness name, additional notes, redundant checks)
  - **Step 3**: Simplified to single "Delivery process completed" confirmation
  - Removed verbose delivery summary and warning alerts
- **API Method Fix**: Changed from non-existent `API.warnings.updateDeliveryStatus()` to `API.warnings.update()`
- **Dashboard Counter Refresh**: Added callback mechanism to refresh metrics after delivery completion
